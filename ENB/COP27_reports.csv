Daily report for 17 November 2022;Sharm El-Sheikh Climate Change Conference - November 2022;https://enb.iisd.org/sharm-el-sheikh-climate-change-conference-cop27-daily-report-17nov2022;"
          
  
      By the end of the penultimate day, it was clear much work remained. Ministerial consultations had yet to find landing zones, response measures and agriculture talks were ongoing, and the overarching cover decision negotiations continued. The COP, CMP, and CMA adopted the decisions on which parties had reached consensus.

Presidency Consultations

Overarching Cover Decisions: Through the afternoon, the Presidency held Heads of Delegation consultations, open to observers, focused on the overarching cover decisions. Wael Aboulmagd (COP Presidency) explained that the Presidency had issued a non-paper containing draft text for cover decisions based on parties’ inputs. He noted the intention to hear parties’ concise inputs on issues they wished to be either highlighted or removed and, based on these, produce a new draft text for Friday, 18 November.

Groups and parties expressed several concerns regarding the process, lamenting, inter alia, the little time remaining to reach consensus and the exclusion of various key issues.

On the structure of the 20-page non-paper, many groups and countries called for shortening it significantly, in addition to streamlining, improving coherence, and removing duplication in the text. Some proposed a focus on the “key pillars of this process,” and others called for using the Glasgow Climate Pact’s structure as a basis.

A large number of groups and parties also stressed the need to build a narrative that speaks to this “implementation COP,” including by communicating how this is being delivered and not delivered and for the text to provide “a clear direction of travel” for the process. Many called for reaffirming the Glasgow Climate Pact and using it as a starting point, and not backtracking from its language but rather strengthening it. Many also stressed the need to use agreed terminology, and some developing country groups cautioned against reinterpreting the Paris Agreement.

Both developed and developing countries and groups described the text as unbalanced, but views differed on what would actually make it more balanced. Developing countries stressed the principles of the Convention and its Paris Agreement and called for an emphasis on finance and other means of implementation, including highlighting gaps, needs, loss and damage finance and a related fund or facility, adaptation finance, and fulfilling commitments. Some developed and developing countries and groups called for more emphasis on mitigation, including a “follow-up” on nationally determined contributions (NDCs), long-term strategies, and transparency.

On substantive elements, parties also highlighted as important, among others: science, including the need to peak emissions in 2025; a roadmap to doubling adaptation finance; Paris Agreement Article 2.1(c) (on finance flows consistent with low-emissions and climate-resilient development); social dialogue; unilateral coercive measures; response measures; and the cryosphere and oceans. A developing country group underscored the importance of recognizing the role of forests in staying below 1.5°C.

Parties expressed reservations or objected to references to, inter alia: elements that prejudge outcomes of ongoing discussions or introduce elements parties have already rejected, including a just transition work programme or a Sharm El-Sheikh technology implementation work plan; selective references to findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); other international organizations and processes; and specific sectors or sources of emissions.

Views explicitly diverged on: references to the 1.5°C goal and net-zero emissions by 2050; human rights; gender; multilateral development bank (MDB) reform; debt; diversity of sources of finance; phasing down fossil fuel subsidies or use; methane; REDD+ under Article 6.2 (cooperative approaches); nature-based solutions; energy and food crises; special needs and circumstances of Africa; and referring to “new” country categories, such as low-income countries.

Thanking parties for the wealth of views provided, Aboulmagd noted clear differences still existed in terms of various issues parties either strongly supported or objected to. He said the Presidency would prepare draft text “as soon as possible,” that, as requested by parties, focuses on implementation and signals intent and political commitment, bearing in mind the differences in views. He urged parties to assist the Presidency in delivering a robust and meaningful text.

Stocktaking Plenary: In the evening, COP 27 President Sameh Shoukry convened a stocktaking plenary.

On the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA), Co-Facilitator Aminath Shauna (Maldives) noted two key issues remained: on a proposed framework and how it should inform the 2023 work programme; and on IPCC inputs. She informed that, following bilaterals, the Co-Facilitators had produced a new iteration of text under their authority, which would be published for parties’ consideration.

On finance, particularly the new collective quantified goal (NCQG), Co-Facilitators Bhupender Yadav (India) and Chris Bowen (Australia) noted they had prepared text that could provide a structured approach to further the work of the ad hoc work programme for 2023 and enable a decision on the NCQG in 2024. They will meet with Heads of Delegation to hear parties’ views.

On Article 6 (cooperative implementation) and related issues, Co-Facilitator Grace Fu (Singapore) said new drafts with reduced options had been produced. She said technical-level negotiations would continue in the evening and night to find agreement on the remaining issues.

On the mitigation work programme, Co-Facilitator Dan Jørgensen (Denmark) observed that it was clear parties’ views remained divergent. He said the first round of consultations had resulted in the identification of possible landing zones: reassurance regarding mitigation ambition and the nationally determined nature of NDCs; a time frame until 2030; and a proposal for three decisions throughout the period which fit within the Global Stocktake cycle. Given the lack of agreement, the Co-Facilitators will circulate new drafts and consult on the entire text.

On finance for loss and damage, Co-Facilitators María Heloísa Rojas Corradi (Chile) and Jennifer Morgan (Germany) said they had produced draft text based on multiple bilateral consultations that would be made available shortly, and a meeting would be convened in the evening to hear parties’ reflections on the text.

Mohamed Nasr (COP Presidency) provided updates on the technical negotiations and consultations undertaken by the Presidency. He said that work had concluded on several items. He said new draft text would be circulated on national adaptation plans, and that consultations continued on matters relating to the least developed countries (LDCs). He noted ongoing technical work on finance, including on guidance to the Green Climate Fund and Global Environment Facility, matters related to the Standing Committee on Finance, and long-term finance. He said work is continuing on matters relating to the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), Joint Implementation, Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture (KJWA), response measures, and gender. He highlighted that on the second periodic review of the long-term global goal, the Presidency had circulated a bridging proposal.

On presidency consultations, Nasr reported that streamlined cover decision text will be issued. He said views are divergent on the equitable geographical representation proposal by Georgia, the special needs and circumstances of Africa, and Article 2.1(c), among others.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell called for building on all the work done before. Calling the conversation on finance for loss and damage long overdue, he said the outcome on this issue must be tangible, with clear timelines and milestones.

COP President Shoukry reported there would be another informal stocktaking on Friday, 18 November, followed by additional discussions with parties on the set of decisions to be resolved in a balanced manner. He said new cover decision text would be issued during the night.

The EU, supported by other developed countries, proposed to establish a response fund, under the CMA, for loss and damage for the most vulnerable countries, with a workplan to be agreed upon by the CMA and other efforts, including looking into debt and reforming MDBs. He also stressed as the “other side of the coin,” an outcome on the mitigation work programme that would include, inter alia: a phase-down of all fossil fuels; annual reports on the phase-down of unabated coal and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies; and a request to strengthen and revisit NDCs in 2023.

Switzerland, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, clarified its understanding that “flexibility” on loss and damage finance is contingent on a strong outcome on mitigation and that contributions to a fund would come from a broadened donor base of public and private sources and all countries with a capacity to provide support.

Pakistan, for the G-77/CHINA, underscored there are still many divergent views and unanswered questions on loss and damage finance and the success of COP 27 rests on a strong outcome on this issue.

Ghana, for the CLIMATE VULNERABLE FORUM, urged: the creation of a loss and damage finance facility under the COP and CMA; clear commitments for loss and damage funding; and resources from developed countries and others in a position to provide support.

Colombia, for the INDEPENDENT ALLIANCE OF LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (AILAC), called for text on the EU’s proposal. She reported that the group had prepared text on debt relief which it viewed as crucial to helping create fiscal space for countries to undertake climate action.

Zambia, for the AFRICAN GROUP, said any package must include the GGA.

BOLIVIA, Saudi Arabia, for the ARAB GROUP, and CHINA underscored the need to respect the principles of the Convention and the Paris Agreement. BOLIVIA reported that developed countries were bracketing language on equity and common but differentiated responsibilities in various texts. CHINA said we need to implement the Paris Agreement, and not rewrite it, and underlined that finance flows from developed to developing countries. 

Closing the stocktake, President Shoukry called on parties to redouble their efforts to reach greater convergence over the next day, expressing confidence in their ability to bridge remaining gaps.

COP/CMA

Response Measures: In the morning, SBSTA Chair Tosi Mpanu Mpanu facilitated informal consultations. He said he understood groups wished to work in an “informal informal” setting to develop a bridging proposal and asked delegates to report back in the afternoon. Delegates gathered for bilateral and small group meetings in an attempt to bridge gaps.

In the afternoon, the meeting reconvened. Parties reported that significant differences remained. Mpanu Mpanu suggested three alternatives. The first, he said, was to apply UNFCCC Rule 16 (forwarding the issue to the next COP). However, he warned that this was “a dangerous path because it can have a contagious effect.” He said a second option would be to attempt a short procedural decision, while a third would be to have one last attempt to find a longer text that bridged the differences. He asked delegates to “untangle this so we can serve a lasagna to ministers, rather than a spaghetti bowl.”

Parties agreed to work on less controversial paragraphs, setting aside text on activities related to the midterm review of the workplan of the forum, since that remained contested. They agreed on a number of paragraphs, including text welcoming the annual reports of the Katowice Committee of Experts on the Impacts of the implementation of Response Measures (KCI) and adopting recommendations from the forum, including lessons learned, best practices, tools and methodologies, and enhancing capacity. However, a paragraph on a future workshop was bracketed, with developed countries opposing the text and developing countries supporting it. Consultations continued into the evening.

COP

Organizational Matters: Adoption of the report on credentials: In the closing plenary, chaired by COP 27 President Sameh Shoukry, the COP adopted the report on credentials (FCCC/CP/2022/9). 

Adoption of the rules of procedure: President Shoukry informed that agreement had not been reached on this item and the COP would continue to apply the draft rules of procedure (FCCC/CP/1996/2), with the exception of draft rule 42 (voting).

Dates and venues of future sessions: Parties adopted a decision (FCCC/CP/2022/L.2), which included a date change for COP 28 (now taking place from 30 November to 12 December 2023). The UNITED ARAB EMIRATES expressed its determination to secure a strong outcome at COP 28, with: global solutions that leave no country behind; a new, ambitious deal on finance; a way forward on loss and damage and the GGA; and strong progress on mitigation.

Reports of the Subsidiary Bodies: SBSTA: The COP took note of the reports of SBSTA 56 (FCCC/SBSTA/2022/6) and SBSTA 57 (FCCC/SBSTA/2022/L.17). It also adopted decisions on implementation of the Global Climate Observing System (FCCC/SBSTA/2022/L.20/Add.1); revision of the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories for Annex I parties (FCCC/SBSTA/2022/L.19) as orally amended in the SBSTA 57 closing; and common metrics (FCCC/SBSTA/2022/L.25/Add.1).

 The COP also agreed to conclude the consideration of market and non-market mechanisms under the Convention.

Report of the SBI: The COP took note of the reports of SBI 56 (FCCC/SB/2022/10 and 10/Add.1) and SBI 57 (FCCC/SB/2022/L.17).

The COP also adopted decisions on: revision of the modalities and guidelines for international assessment and review (FCCC/SBI/2022/10/Add.1); and Action for Climate Empowerment (FCCC/SBI/2022/L.23) as orally amended in the SBI 57 closing plenary.

ARMENIA expressed concerns over equitable geographical representation, noting the Consultative Group of Experts (CGE) could not finalize its work on the rules of procedure and asserting discrimination that affected Georgia and others.

Antigua and Barbuda, for the ALLIANCE OF SMALL
ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), supported by Colombia, for AILAC, expressed concern at how the loss and damage financing arrangement issue has been managed. Stating that many feel loss and damage is the “defining issue” for COP 27, she asked where a text was on this matter. President Shoukry said he believed there had been intensive consultation on this issue and the Co-Facilitators will report back in due course. 

Reporting from Non-Annex I Parties: The COP adopted a decision (FCCC/SBI/2022/10/Add.1).

Technology Development and Transfer: Report of the TEC and CTCN: The COP adopted a decision (FCCC/SB/2022/L.12). President Shoukry noted that the election of the members of these two bodies will be taken up at the conclusion of the COP.

Linkages between the Technology Mechanism and the Financial Mechanism: The COP took note that the discussion will continue at SBI 58.

Capacity Building: Annual technical progress report of the Paris Committee on Capacity-building (PCCB) for 2022: The COP adopted a decision (FCCC/SBI/2022/L.19). President Shoukry informed that the election of the PCCB members would be taken up at the conclusion of the COP.

Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Milagros Sandoval (Peru) and Ayman Amin (COP Presidency), Sandoval asked if the revised iteration of the draft decision text was acceptable to all.

A developing country said the term “mitigation” in the text on agriculture is a red line, calling it unfair for small farmers to take on the burden of mitigation. As a compromise, he proposed two additions: in a paragraph on the need for enhanced climate action on agriculture and food security, recognition “that such actions are context-specific and take into account national circumstances”; and in a paragraph on the four-year joint work, that developed countries should take the lead, and parties recognize that adaptation is an “overriding” priority for vulnerable groups. Some developed countries urged supporting the text as is.

After parties huddled to try breaking the impasse, bridging proposals were made, which were not accepted. Amin closed the meeting, saying the revised iteration introduced for this informal consultation would be forwarded to the COP Presidency.

Administrative, Financial and Institutional Matters: The COP adopted decisions on the audit report and financial statements for 2021 (FCCC/SBI/2022/10/Add.1) and budget performance for the biennium 2020-2021 (FCCC/SBI/L.17/Add.1). On a sub-item on decision making in the UNFCCC process, President Shoukry noted views remained divergent. The COP agreed to place this item on the provisional agenda of the next session.

CMA

Organizational Matters: Credentials: In the closing plenary, the CMA approved the report (FCCC/CMA/2022/9).

Reports of the Subsidiary Bodies: SBSTA: The CMA took note of the oral report by SBSTA Chair Mpanu Mpanu and the SBSTA 56 and 57 reports (FCCC/SBSTA/2022/L.17 and FCCC/SBSTA/2022/6).

SBI: The CMA took note of the oral report by SBI Chair Karlsen and the SBI 56 and 57 reports (FCCC/SBI/2022/10 and Add.1 and FCCC/SBI/2022/L.18). The CMA also adopted a decision on matters relating to Action for Climate Empowerment as orally amended in the SBI 57 closing plenary (FCCC/SBI/2022/L.23).

Reporting and Review Pursuant to Article 13 (Enhanced Transparency Framework: Provision of financial and technical support: The CMA took note of the SBI 57 conclusions on this item (FCCC/SBI/2022/L.25).

CMP

Organizational Matters: Credentials: In the closing plenary, the CMP approved the report (FCCC/KP/CMP/2022/8).

Reports of the Subsidiary Bodies: SBSTA: The CMP took note of the oral report by SBSTA Chair Mpanu Mpanu and the SBSTA 56 and 57 reports (FCCC/SBSTA/2022/L.17 and FCCC/SBSTA/2022/6). 

SBI: The CMP took note of the oral report by SBI Chair Karlsen and the SBI 56 and 57 reports (FCCC/SBI/2022/10 and Add.1 and FCCC/SBI/2022/L.18). The SBI also took note of the report of the administrator of the international transaction log under the Kyoto Protocol (FCCC/KP/CMP/2022/5).

Reporting to and from Annex I Parties: Date of completion of the expert review process under Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol for the second commitment period: The CMP adopted a decision (FCCC/SBI/2022/10/Add.1).

Matters Relating to the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM): In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Alick Muvundika (Zambia) and Kazuhisa Koakutsu (Japan) urged bridging proposals.

On the issuance process for certified emission reductions (CERs) and voluntary cancellation process, countries agreed to delete the relevant paragraphs and include the issue in a request for further technical work from the Secretariat.

On continuation of methodology processes, countries agreed to delete these paragraphs and include the issues in a request to the Secretariat for further technical work. Parties debated the scope of the review or update of methodologies, with some developing countries suggesting that it should be limited to correcting inconsistencies and errors. Other countries, developed and developing, urged the inclusion of environmental integrity in the scope of the assessment.

Parties also agreed to delete a paragraph on the handover of accreditation procedures and request further technical work.

On temporary measures related to afforestation and reforestation, there was general agreement to request the Executive Board to explore and implement, as appropriate and as a priority, requests for registration, issuance, and renewal of these activities. This was agreed to expedite the process and avoid the need for a future CMP decision.

Parties agreed to delete the paragraph related to a voluntary cancellation process for post-2020 units.

On the transfer of CERs to the mechanism registry, there was an agreement to remove language related to use toward NDCs, but there was no agreement on whether written approval from the host party would be necessary after concerns were expressed about the number of written approvals that would be required.

Parties agreed to recall paragraph 22 of Decision 2/CMP.16 (on guidance to the CDM) requesting the SBI to review the status of the Trust Fund in place of a paragraph determining the amount to be transferred to the Adaptation Fund.

In a contact group in the afternoon, discussions continued on the bracketed text on transferring CERs to the mechanism registry. The debate concerned the role of the host country and whether confirmation would be necessary or if the absence of an objection could suffice. They agreed that the host country would be notified and, if no objection is received within a time frame to be determined by the Executive Board, the approval would be granted. With that and additional changes regarding temporary measures on afforestation and reforestation, the text was approved by the contact group.

Capacity-building: The CMP took note of the SBI 56 conclusions under this item (FCCC/SBI/2022/10).

Report of the Compliance Committee: The CMP adopted a decision (FCCC/KP/CMP/2022/L.1).

Report on the High-level Ministerial Round Table on Increased Ambition of Kyoto Protocol Commitments: President Shoukry informed that parties had not reached consensus on this matter, and it would be included on the provisional agenda for CMP 18.

Administrative, Financial and Institutional Matters: The CMP adopted decisions on budget performance for the biennium 2020–2021 (FCCC/SBI/2022/10/Add.1) and the audit report and financial statements for 2021 (FCCC/SBI/2022/L.17/Add.2).

In the Corridors

Solidarity summed up the penultimate day. At times, it was abundant. Activists came together in the Peoples’ Plenary, standing together under the banner of climate justice: “There is one word they fear the most: solidarity.” The crowd’s cheers reverberated through the room for a youth activist who proclaimed, “We belong in the text, not in the preamble!” 

Developing countries likewise stood together. The G-77/China, AOSIS, LDCs, and AILAC held an emergency press conference to tell the media of their deep frustration over the loss and damage finance negotiations. “At a minimum,” they wanted the establishment of a finance facility from this meeting. To the world, they shared how climate change is already affecting their countries, with Minister Sherry Rehman from Pakistan opining that “vulnerability should not become a death sentence.” In his own press conference, UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for a “Climate Solidarity Pact.” 

Other times, solidarity was notably absent. The “laundry list” for the overarching cover decisions grew considerably, and still, parties attempted to add in their issues and objected to the preferences of others. Technical-level talks on the NCQG added “brackets around paragraphs, around sentences, and within sentences” to at least 35 paragraphs, a finance negotiator glumly observed.

As the evening plenary became a nighttime informal stocktaking session, developed countries showed their own solidarity, with many supporting the EU’s proposal to establish a loss and damage facility for the most vulnerable countries, paired with an outcome on the mitigation work programme. Others noted the need for a broad donor base for this facility. Some applauded, others noted additional and fundamental issues the proposal raised, and still others suggested their own crucial parts of the package. COP President Shoukry implored countries to remember the global community’s expectations as he urged compromise.

      Negotiations moved slowly on several issues, particularly finance. For other issues, texts were forwarded to the COP Presidency or ministers for further consideration. Agreement on a decision on the Santiago Network was met with applause from negotiators. Talks on the Adaptation Fund Board also reached compromise.

COP

Matters Related to Finance: Long-term finance: In informal consultations in the morning, Co-Facilitators Carlos Fuller (Belize) and Gertraud Wollansky (Austria) invited general comments on a new, streamlined draft decision text. Wollansky informed the group they had until 6:00 pm to conclude negotiations. Parties began to work through the text, exchanging a range of views on each paragraph while making only limited progress in bridging gaps. A developing country group sought to delete language he felt shifted obligations from governments to the private sector, while developed countries pointed out it repeated previously-agreed language. With ongoing differences over most paragraphs and multiple brackets remaining, Wollansky invited parties to meet informally.

Second Periodic Review of the Long-term Global Goal under the Convention (LTGG): In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Leon Charles (Grenada) and Andrew Ferrone (Luxembourg) presented a new draft decision text. Developed countries underlined that it represents their “maximum flexibility.”

Views sharply diverged on references to action before 2030, including peaking emissions between now and 2025, deep emissions reductions by 2030, and enhanced efforts under the Convention and Paris Agreement. Two developing country groups rejected the references to short-term goals in the context of the LTGG and suggested this “violates equity.” Other developed and developing countries stressed the importance of action in this decade in line with science. A developed country objected to references to both the Convention and Paris Agreement, which were supported by some developing countries.

After a developing country suggested adding a reference to historic emissions, some developed countries opined that a procedural conclusion may be needed.

Co-Facilitator Charles said the text and parties’ views would be relayed to the COP Presidency, including bracketed options on how to refer to equity, on which views continued to differ.

CMA

Glasgow–Sharm El-Sheikh Work Programme on the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA): In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) sought parties’ comments on draft text capturing parties’ submissions and views. Kumarsingh read out an amendment to include inadvertently omitted text at the beginning of a paragraph on a framework for the GGA: “Decides to establish a framework with its dimensions, themes, cross-cutting considerations, indicators/metrics/targets as appropriate, and sources of information for achieving the goal…”

Parties expressed their preferred options and provided additional textual proposals. Views remained divergent, particularly on engagement with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and on whether to establish a framework at CMA 4. Some developed countries expressed interest in a compromise proposal for a structured approach and consideration of a framework in 2023.

Kumarsingh urged parties to engage informally to reduce the issues for ministers to resolve and asked parties to update the Co-Facilitators on progress by email.

Santiago Network of the Warsaw International Mechanism: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Lucas di Pietro (Argentina) and Cornelia Jäger (Austria), breakout groups presented compromise text, which di Pietro asked for consideration as a package. After several parties sought to reinsert and debate previous proposals, parties switched to an informal informal setting.

Informal consultations reconvened with a report that parties had reached agreement. They agreed, inter alia: to recall the Paris Agreement and relevant COP and CMA decisions in the preambular text; that, in providing technical assistance, the Network should take into consideration the cross-cutting issues in the Paris Agreement preamble, paragraph 11 (on human rights, the rights of Indigenous Peoples, local communities, and vulnerable communities, and gender equality and intergenerational equity); to encourage “others” to provide support for the Network’s operation and technical assistance; and, in the criteria for host selection, to ensure ethical standards in the governance and management structure.

Work Programme under the Framework for Non-market Approaches Referred to in Article 6.8: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Maria Al-Jishi (Saudi Arabia) and Jacqueline Ruesga (New Zealand), parties shared views on all sections of new draft decision text, issued the same morning, and in particular a section on a UNFCCC web-based platform for non-market approaches (NMAs). Parties also reported on constructive discussions in informal informals held the previous night.

On the platform, a developing country group clarified its vision of how actors involved with NMAs and support would first register relevant information via the platform, followed by both “roundtable working groups” to facilitate their matching and in-session workshops summarizing related outcomes. Parties exchanged views on, inter alia: the platform’s functions, namely recording of information and/or matchmaking; role of possible focal points; whether matching is a party-driven process or requires the Secretariat’s support; whether to refer to “matching” or “identification of opportunities”; and whether to mandate the Secretariat to assess the matching process.

On a proposed capacity-building programme, some groups called for first defining what is meant by NMAs and what capacity building under Article 6.8 would focus on. Despite this, they expressed openness to exploring related activities under the broader umbrella of Article 6.

Noting productive exchanges, the Co-Facilitators informed they would integrate inputs received in a further text iteration, to be made available on Thursday afternoon, 17 November, and consult with the Presidency on the way forward.

COP/CMA

Matters Relating to Finance: New collective quantified goal on climate finance: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Zaheer Fakir (South Africa) and Georg Børsting (Norway) informed parties that ministers had been given two contentious paragraphs to consider and invited this group to work on the rest of the text. Some developed countries expressed concern with the latest, third iteration of text and proposed reverting to the previous version. Many developing countries strongly opposed this, preferring the latest version, which they argued was more substantive. One party voiced unease that ministers were already being tasked with specific work when it was not clear which areas needed the most work or the exact text on which this work would be based.

Fakir explained the process so far, noting that no one had objected to the second iteration of the text, which had prompted further input and resulted in the third iteration. He explained that the intention had been to generate views on this text and then hold informal informals. He further explained that ministers would consider only key substantive, contentious, political topics, rather than detailed text. Given parties’ divergent views and concerns, he indicated he would consult with the COP Presidency and report back on the way forward.

Guidance to the Green Climate Fund (GCF): In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Richard Muyungi (Tanzania) and Toru Sugio (Japan) invited comments on a new iteration of the text. Delegates made progress on several paragraphs, although many differences remained. One developing country group sought text to “at least double” funding from the GCF-1 replenishment period, but this was not supported by developed countries. With delegates unable to agree, the Co-Facilitators will take up the issue with the Presidency.

Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Monika Figaj (Poland) and Ayman Amin (COP Presidency) informed parties that the Presidency and Co-Facilitators had produced a draft decision text as a “last resort,” following the previous day’s stalled negotiations. Amin outlined key proposals, including: alternatives for the term “climate action”; joint work to last four years; the SBs to report at COP 31 (2026); “food systems” as the first workshop topic; and a call for submissions on other workshops’ topics.

Some parties expressed support and urged against multiple textual insertions, recognizing this was clearly a “compromise text.” Some developing country groups and parties proposed changes they referred to as priorities, including submissions on operationalizing the joint work’s objectives and capturing parties’ views in a synthesis report. Views strongly diverged on certain items, including how to refer to those institutions or bodies that should take account of the SBs’ conclusions in implementing adaptation and mitigation actions. Informal informals continued into the night.

Response Measures: In informal consultations held throughout the afternoon and into the evening, co-facilitated by Andrei Marcu (Papua New Guinea) and Daniel Waterschoot (EU), parties continued working on a draft decision text. Developing countries expressed concern at the lack of progress, noted this was a very important issue for them, and urged developed countries to engage constructively. Parties engaged in lengthy discussions as they worked their way gradually through the text, making numerous suggested edits and alterations. As of early evening, discussions were continuing, with a number of brackets remaining.

CMP

Matters Relating to the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM): In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Kazuhisa Koakutsu (Japan) invited parties to explore bridging proposals in a new iteration of draft decision text issued the previous day, relating to: the functioning of the CDM beyond the end of the Kyoto Protocol second commitment period, including processes relating to certified emission reduction (CER) issuance, methodologies, accreditation, afforestation and reforestation, and voluntary cancellation of post-2020 units; and management of financial resources.

On processes, a developing country group presented a bridging proposal to combine elements from the two main options in the text, namely setting dates or timeframes for individual processes, or mandating technical work by the Secretariat first, which was supported in principle by many parties. Specific elements discussed included: whether to allow for the continuation of bottom-up submissions of new methodologies and top-down revision of existing ones; and ensuring a holistic approach to the “end of the CDM.”

A proposal by a developing country on allowing voluntary cancellations for post-2020 CERs was supported by another developing country and group. However, this was opposed by several groups and parties, which stated that: as decided in Glasgow (Decision 2/CMP.16), issuance for post-2020 emission reductions is not possible; and requests under temporary measures “stop” where they are recorded, meaning “temporary CERs” do not exist. Instead of mandating further work, as suggested by some, the proponent country said the urgency of this matter requires political resolution at this CMP.

On the management of financial resources, proposals included: undertaking, in 2023, a holistic assessment of these resources and how they should be used; and allocating a specific amount from the CDM Trust Fund to the Adaptation Fund already at this CMP.

Noting good progress, Koakutsu said the Co-Facilitators would issue a revised text and consult with the Presidency on the way forward.

CMP/CMA

Report of the Adaptation Fund Board: In informal consultations, delegates concluded their work on draft texts relating to the Adaptation Fund Board, agreeing on decisions for the CMP and CMA. The texts, inter alia, welcome financial pledges to the Fund and encourage continued and increased contributions. Co-Facilitators Diann Black-Layne (Antigua and Barbuda) and Eva Schreuder (Netherlands) thanked delegates for their flexibility in reaching an agreed outcome.

In the Corridors

People were trying to get a sense of this COP. One delegate said it “seemed stuck in gear” and another likened it to trying to run on ice. COP finance and long-term global goal talks were testy. In both, the negotiators somewhat reluctantly gave up control of some texts to the COP Presidency and ministers. At the same time, some felt that work on the overarching cover decisions pulled key people out of other negotiation rooms. But, applause echoing from the Santiago Network talks provided a much-needed sense of hope and one said he was applauding “on behalf of vulnerable countries and communities.”

How to support those most impacted by, and least responsible for, climate change has been central to many discussions at this COP at and away from the negotiation table. The Global Shield Against Climate Risks, launched two days ago by the G7 and V20, demonstrated, as one delegate put it, “real, monetary recognition that people need loss and damage finance to survive.” It aims to pre-arrange finance and insurance solutions for seven climate-vulnerable countries before a disaster strikes. But, at a civil society event on the Shield, some questioned the move, worrying that it could undermine the calls for a funding facility to be established at this COP. One observer blasted “it’s just insurance for a few, and ignores so much of what loss and damage is about.”

With more texts in the hands of the Presidency and anticipation of first versions of cover decision texts at the end of the day, there were questions on how all this would come together, both in terms of the package to be built and how the Presidency will interpret the assembly instructions written by parties.

      While ministers gave high-level speeches that relayed their national priorities, negotiators worked to clear as much of the backlog of pending issues as possible. By the end of the day, numerous issues remained unresolved. Ministers will take up a shortlist of issues to bridge the remaining differences.

Presidency’s Consultations

Cover Decisions: Heads of delegation met in a session open to observers, co-facilitated by Wael Aboulmagd and Mohamed Nasr (Egypt), who invited parties’ comments on a non-paper on the cover decisions’ elements. 

Many called for a focus on implementation, expressing differing views on how to, as one phrased it, “infuse” implementation into the decision. For three developing country groups, equity and common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR) were central, with one urging recognizing implementation gaps throughout. Several pointed to implementing all aspects of the Glasgow Climate Pact, including phasing down coal, reducing methane emissions, supporting just transitions, and providing adaptation finance. Several shared a preference for text on accountability on all aspects of the Glasgow Climate Pact in a balanced manner, while two groups preferred improving transparency and called for deleting the term accountability.

On 1.5°C, many supported its inclusion, with one group characterizing it as a “red line.” Two groups preferred referring to the Paris Agreement temperature goal instead. 

Additional ideas included: establishing a two-year work programme on the Technology Mechanism; ending the expansion of new fossil fuel production; phasing out, or phasing down, oil and gas extraction; establishing a loss and damage response fund; inviting the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to prepare a special report on adaptation; requesting the Standing Committee on Finance to prepare a report on indebtedness due to climate change; and expressing disappointment at developed countries’ failure to reach the USD 100 billion climate finance goal.

Among the topics suggested for removal were: multilateral development banks (MDBs); the private sector; nature-based solutions; organizations and initiatives outside the UNFCCC; and any new mandates that may renegotiate or reinterpret the Paris Agreement.

Many called for a more substantive written text. Consultations will continue.

Stocktaking Plenary: In the evening, COP 27 President Sameh Shoukry convened a short stocktaking plenary. He informed delegates that while progress has been made, more work was needed to drive ambitious climate action. He noted that some issues required further technical work, which he hoped would be concluded by Wednesday, 16 November. However, other issues would require higher-level political engagement. He proposed ministerial consultations, as follows:

Mitigation work programme, chaired by ministers Barbara Creesy (South Africa) and Dan Jørgensen (Denmark);
	Global Goal on Adaptation, chaired by Aminath Shauna (Maldives) and Teresa Ribera (Spain);
	Finance, particularly the new collective quantified goal (NCQG), chaired by Bhupender Yadav (India) and Chris Bowen (Australia);
	Article 6 and related issues, chaired by Grace Fu (Singapore) and Espen Barth Eide (Norway); and
	Finance for loss and damage, chaired by María Heloísa Rojas Corradi (Chile) and Jennifer Morgan (Germany).
President Shoukry indicated he would meet with all facilitators and continue to assess how to move forward.

COP

Matters Related to Finance: Long-term finance: Carlos Fuller (Belize) and Gertraud Wollansky (Austria) co-facilitated informal consultations, inviting general comments on a revised draft decision text. A developing country group said some paragraphs misinterpreted agreements already reached and that the document should also reflect the need for increasing ambition. He called for removing references to initiatives outside the UNFCCC process. Another developing country group said the text should better balance adaptation and mitigation, while another group sought more direct language on MDBs increasing the share of funding provided as grants.

A developed country described the draft as unbalanced, given inadequate reference to developed countries’ efforts and progress to date. Another developed country called for streamlining duplicative text on the USD 100 billion commitment, while other developed countries urged streamlining and shortening the text generally.

Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture (KJWA): In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Monika Figaj (Poland) described changes in the new published text, reflecting submissions received after informal informals the previous evening. These included: revising the title to highlight the importance of implementation and action; splitting the request for parties’ submissions into two on the work programme, and on operationalization of the online platform; and requesting the Subsidiary Bodies to report to COP 30. Figaj noted that bracketed options remained around establishing either a three-year or open-ended joint work programme to implement the KJWA outcomes.

Several groups and parties thanked the Co-Facilitators for the revised text, describing it as a good basis for discussions. An observer reminded parties of the need to ensure food security, ecosystem integrity, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable land use. Informal informals convened in the afternoon.

Second Periodic Review of the Long-term Global Goal under the Convention (LTGG): In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Andrew Ferrone (Luxembourg) sought parties’ “maximum flexibility” to find convergence. 

Discussions focused on a paragraph on equity, containing two heavily bracketed options on how to reflect the importance of equity in achieving the LTGG, one of which reflected Convention language. Views remained strongly divergent, including on a new third option supported by some developed countries, which noted “parties have different starting positions, face different circumstances, and have different opportunities to contribute to achieving the LTGG.” Several developing countries opposed the third option, cautioning against redefining agreed Convention language relating to equity and CBDR. The Co-Facilitators will produce a new iteration of text.

CMA

Glasgow–Sharm El-Sheikh Work Programme on the Global Goal on Adaptation: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Mattias Frumerie (Sweden) requested parties to focus interventions on technical elements, including modalities, timelines and submissions for the 2023 work programme. Some developing country groups underscored that discussing the framework first is crucial, to inform the modalities discussion. A developed country proposed a compromise between a framework and a structured approach and using the 2023 workshops to accommodate both: for the first two, a structured approach to complete the work programme and consider inputs for the GST; and for the last two, to consider the need for a framework for future work. 

On modalities, parties converged on holding the 2023 workshops in person with the option for virtual participation, which developing country groups underscored should enable full and active participation. Informal consultations continued late into the night.

Santiago Network of the Warsaw International Mechanism: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Cornelia Jäger (Austria) and Lucas di Pietro (Argentina), a report back from informal informals noted good progress on “85-90% of the text.” Four topics remained outstanding: funding of the Santiago Network; composition of the Network’s Executive Committee; access modalities; and review. Parties continued in informal informals into the evening, and informal consultations will resume on Wednesday morning, 16 November.

Matters Related to Finance: NCQG: In the morning, Co-Facilitator Zaheer Fakir (South Africa) invited inputs on the latest draft text. Many parties saw the text as a good basis for further discussion. A developed country said some elements of the text seemed contradictory. A group of developing countries called for more ambition in the text.

A developed country said any proposal to include a specific financial quantum was premature. Another developed country said the NCQG could ultimately include quantitative and qualitative elements.

On the options for topics for the thematic expert dialogues, several developed countries opposed going beyond 2023 in setting out the topics, with one adding the text should stress the importance of expert advice and be action-oriented.

A group of developing countries cautioned against preambular paragraphs with new language that has not been previously agreed and described discussions related to the contributor base as a “non-starter,” adding 2023 will be a critical year for moving towards the new target.

Guidance on Cooperative Approaches Referred to in Article 6.2: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Peer Stiansen (Norway) and Co-Chairs Kuki Soejachmoen (Indonesia), parties exchanged views on sections of draft decision text on: the Article 6 database; centralized accounting and reporting platform (CARP); registries; and outline of the initial report.

On the database and CARP, parties called for, inter alia: explaining the interoperability between the two; clarifying the database’s functionality and the information it will capture; further elaborating on the consistency check procedure for information submitted; and further work on common nomenclatures.

On registries, parties identified two views for the design of the international registry, one seeing it as being used for recording and accounting purposes only and the other viewing it should also allow for the movement of units. Many supported working on a bridging approach that would accommodate both views with the latter function being optional for parties, with one developing country group proposing starting as an accounting registry and then building toward a trading registry.

Parties called for improving understanding on the relationships between different registries, with some stressing the Article 6.4 registry and international registry. One group raised the need to consider the costs of data reconciliation in a non-centralized system. A developing country group cautioned against making data from the international registry automatically publicly available.

On the initial report, several groups and parties described agreeing on the outline and the report’s review as priorities at this CMA. Developed countries and two developing country groups supported including illustrative text in the outline, including on a provisional basis and for use in capacity building, opposed by two developing country groups, which said it introduces further requirements.

The Co-Facilitators encouraged parties to continue consulting informally and said they would consult with the Presidency on the way forward.

Rules, Modalities and Procedures for the Mechanism Established by Article 6.4: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Kate Hancock (Australia) and Sonam Tashi (Bhutan), parties completed a round of reviews of a draft decision text.

On a section on host party reporting, parties clarified their understanding relating to Article 6.2 accounting and reporting requirements triggered by authorization of Article 6.4 emission reductions (A6.4ERs), including regarding the initial report. Many supported referencing relevant Glasgow text in the cover part of the decision instead of this section. In response to a developing country group’s concern on creating duplication in reporting obligations, some noted that the review under Article 6.4 focuses on the activity level while that under Article 6.2 focuses on the country level.

On the mechanism registry’s operation, two groups underscored the need to clarify what non-authorized units are, their uses, and the process for issuing them, with one suggesting designing a registry requires understanding its basic specifications. A developing country group disagreed, saying that parties have “nothing to do” with non-authorized A6.4ERs and comparing these to voluntary carbon market units currently in circulation. One developing country stated that countries will wish to use the Article 6.4 mechanism to generate credits for domestic uses. Another developing country group suggested, as a bridging proposal, requesting all parties to indicate which use they are authorizing units for.

Parties also briefly discussed: administrative and adaptation shares of proceeds; paragraphs in the cover part of the decision; and processes for delivering overall mitigation in global emissions (OMGE). On OMGE, parties debated whether OMGE cancellations should, or can, apply to non-authorized A6.4ERs, with some noting only a corresponding adjustment delivers OMGE.

In the afternoon, parties continued discussions on sections on national arrangements and avoidance, and on the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body’s recommendations, including mandating work for the Body for 2023. The Co-Facilitators encouraged parties to consult informally in the evening.

Work Programme under the Framework for Non-market Approaches Referred to in Article 6.8: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Maria Al-Jishi (Saudi Arabia) and Jacqueline Ruesga (New Zealand), parties shared views on sections in draft decision text on: additional focus areas of the non-market approaches work programme activities; a coordination network and working groups; and inputs to the activities’ review in 2026. Parties reported back from informal informals the previous evening, indicating the discussion resulted in one bridging proposal and clarified parties’ views.

Parties debated at length ways to streamline a list of 24 potential additional focus areas, with many calling for clustering these under the three focus areas agreed in Glasgow (decision 4/CMA.3), relating to adaptation, mitigation, and clean energy. A developing country group expressed hesitation, stressing the need for a holistic and integrated view. Many noted the list included both themes and initiatives and processes, with one group calling for removing REDD+. Most parties converged on a bridging proposal to call for additional submissions and mandate the Secretariat to produce a synthesis report of ways to align the areas.

On a network and working groups, developing countries stressed their importance in facilitating coordination and matching between needs and support, with some developed countries opposing their establishment saying this would delay the work programme’s implementation. Most parties supported a proposal by a developing country group to postpone the decision and mandate the Secretariat to undertake an analysis of relevant best practices under the UNFCCC.

On the review, Al-Jishi noted that the original proponents of this section had agreed to delete it as premature, but a developing country group opposed its deletion at this stage.

The Co-Facilitators invited parties to submit further bridging proposals and will issue a new iteration of the text by Wednesday morning, 16 November.

COP/CMA

Matters Relating to Finance: Matters relating to the Standing Committee on Finance: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Dominic Molloy (UK) invited reflections on a revised draft incorporating previous input and discussions. Delegates commented on various sections of the text, however many issues remained unresolved. Several parties suggested separating this text into two decisions, one under the COP and the other under the CMA. Several speakers also proposed streamlining the text, with a range of suggestions and opinions. Consultations will continue.

Guidance to the Global Environment Facility (GEF): In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Toru Sugio (Japan) and Richard Muyungi (Tanzania) invited comments on the draft text circulated on Sunday, 13 November. Many welcomed it as a good basis for discussion.

Disagreement surfaced over text responding to various GEF-related changes or events, such as the GEF-8 replenishment. While developed countries generally sought to “welcome” these, many developing countries preferred to either “note” them or express disappointment, for instance at the level of funding change for GEF-8 over the previous replenishment.

Some developing countries sought to remove a reference to identity in the context of gender, while developed countries sought its retention on the grounds that greater inclusivity is important. One developed country noted that parallel negotiations are ongoing on this and other issues, and said discussions under this item should draw on their work where possible.

On text relating to the GEF System for Transparent Allocation of Resources (STAR), a developing country group said parties should not use political means to bar specific countries from receiving climate funding. Consultations will continue.

Guidance to the Green Climate Fund (GCF): In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Richard Muyungi (Tanzania) introduced a new iteration of text. Delegates welcomed it as a sound basis for their work, and many proposed further deletions and streamlining. Several suggested removing text that they viewed amounted to micromanagement. A group of developing countries reiterated concerns about references to Paris Agreement Article 2.1(c) (on finance flows consistent with low-emissions and climate-resilient development) on the grounds that they should be seen in the context of Article 9 (finance) and Article 2.2 (equity and CBDR). One group of developing countries said the text should include additional guidance, such as for the Independent Technical Advisory Panel (ITAP), and expressed frustration at the lack of a “risk appetite.” A developed country proposed changing local community “rights” to “interests.” Consultations resumed late in the evening.

In the Corridors

The list of outstanding issues stubbornly refused to shorten. Parties tried switching up the settings, working in “informal informals” and Presidency consultations, but few signs of progress radiated into the halls. In addition to the many technical issues, one delegate opined that “hopes of recognizing the special circumstances of Africa—while in Africa—are dim.” The 3+ hour “HOD” consultation on the overarching cover decisions left many wondering how this can wrap up in the time remaining. One delegate leaving the meeting mused “the list of issues is now even longer and we still have no actual text” and another wondered how these decisions “have so quickly taken on a life of their own.”

Ministers will now take over some, but not all issues. Some, such as gender, agriculture, and response measures, were perhaps deemed too technical. Finance negotiators hoping for political interventions may be disappointed. Ministers will only discuss the NCQG. The many other finance issues will be left to negotiators, at least for the time being.

      Monday began with a recognition of the significant volume of work ahead. The Subsidiary Bodies forwarded a long list of issues to this second week of talks, adding to the slate of political-level discussions on key issues to be facilitated by ministers and the Presidency later in the week.

Presidency’s Consultations

Informal Stocktake Plenary: COP President Sameh Shoukry outlined three tracks of work for the week. He explained that technical work would continue on the 13 agenda items left outstanding from the Subsidiary Bodies, spanning mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, agriculture, gender, and response measures. Presidency consultations will also continue on the cover decisions and other issues identified in the opening plenaries. Ministerial consultations will begin Wednesday, 16 November.

Loss and Damage Governance: Facilitated by Amr Essam (Egypt), parties debated whether the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM) is governed by the CMA only, or both the CMA and the COP. All developing country groups supported that the WIM be governed by the COP and CMA. A few developed countries said their interpretation of the Paris Agreement is that the WIM is only under the CMA, with one expressing flexibility to explore dual authority. Parties agreed to take this discussion up next year, and for this year use the “Glasgow approach,” whereby the COP would endorse the CMA’s outcomes. 

COP

National Adaptation Plans: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Pepetua Latasi (Tuvalu) and Jens Fugl (Denmark), Latasi sought comments on the latest draft decision text.

On a paragraph highlighting the importance of scaling up adaptation action and support, one group suggested shortening the text by simply referring to the adaptation sections of the Glasgow Climate Pact (decision 1/CP.26), particularly the call for developed country parties to significantly scale up their provision of adaptation finance.

Three developed countries pointed to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) guidance agenda item as a more appropriate forum to discuss GCF adaptation funding specifically. Several developing country groups disagreed and emphasized the need for implementation and action, expressing dissatisfaction with language simply “underscoring” the importance of this matter. Consultations will continue.

CMA

High-level Ministerial Roundtable on Pre-2030 Ambition: COP 27 President Shoukry relayed that the Presidency will prepare an informal note to reflect the views expressed at this roundtable.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell called for an ambitious mitigation work programme that would reduce emissions faster, catalyze impactful actions, and secure assurances from key parties that they will raise ambition.

Bernd Hackmann, UNFCCC Secretariat, presented the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) Synthesis Report, which provides an overview of current and updated NDCs, highlighting that their implementation would raise emissions 10.6% by 2030.

Jim Skea, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group III Co-Chair, relayed major findings from the group’s report on mitigation, stressing that options exist in all sectors that could halve emissions from 2019 levels and cost less than 100 USD per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent, or even pay for themselves. 

Hong Patterson, GCF, highlighted the Fund’s Sustainable Renewables Risk Mitigation Initiative, which supports six African countries and Uzbekistan to address challenges to private sector investment in renewable energy. 

Ministers delivered a common call to urgently ramp up ambition, with several developing countries stressing the need for support. On the mitigation work programme, SINGAPORE expressed concern that current text on the table may lead to a series of “talk shops,” and the UK called for clear modalities. Bhutan, for the LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCs), called for a clear calendar of milestones for countries to follow.

On the COP 27 cover decisions, JAPAN, TUVALU, and others called for an emphasis on mitigation ambition. AUSTRALIA suggested a commitment to move toward 100% renewable energy.

On fossil fuels, Antigua and Barbuda, for the ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), stressed that safeguarding future generations means stranding assets. TUVALU and VANUATU called for a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty and the UK called for stepping up efforts to phase out coal.

On support, BOLIVIA, GABON, and other developing countries stressed the need to deliver on previous financial promises and ensure support for just transitions. Citing the need to “mobilize trillions” in financial support, the EU underscored the private sector’s role.

Glasgow–Sharm El-Sheikh Work Programme on the Global Goal on Adaptation: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Mattias Frumerie (Sweden) and Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) requested parties to streamline the text where possible and, where views diverged, to set out options. Several parties reiterated that their proposals were not reflected in the text and sought their incorporation. Others identified red lines.

On an option for a framework to guide future work, supported by many developing country groups and opposed by some developed countries, some parties expressed willingness to find a middle ground and consider “a structured approach” to guide the work programme and contribute to the Global Stocktake.

The Co-Facilitators urged parties to discuss among themselves using the Co-Facilitators’ text, resisting several parties’ requests for new text incorporating submissions. Due to disagreement on next steps, the Co-Facilitators said they will seek the Presidency’s guidance on the way forward.

Matters Related to Finance: New collective quantified goal on climate finance: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Zaheer Fakir (South Africa) and Georg Børsting (Norway), a group of developing countries said the current text was too procedural and needed more substance. Parties also discussed how prescriptive the text should be in its guidance on topics for future technical expert dialogues, with some questioning whether it should “micromanage” future topics at this stage. Consultations will continue.

Matters relating to the Adaptation Fund: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Diann Black-Layne (Antigua and Barbuda) and Eva Schreuder (Netherlands) invited views on the draft text, which they said was mirrored in CMP text, as appropriate.

On a paragraph underscoring the urgency of scaling up financial resources, several developing country groups asked to specify that “developed country parties” should provide support to developing countries, with others seeking to add, “in particular, small island developing states (SIDS) and LDCs.” One developing country group opposed specifying groups for support.

Three developed countries, opposed by a developing country group, suggested adding a paragraph emphasizing the importance of Paris Agreement parties’ full participation in Adaptation Fund discussions.

Many engaged with a proposal to note with concern certain countries’ ineligibility to access the Adaptation Fund Climate Innovation Accelerator. The Co-Facilitators will circulate new draft text. 

Matters relating to funding arrangements responding to loss and damage: Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Julio Cordano (Chile) and Ursula Fuentes (Germany), who introduced an elements paper that aims to capture all ideas. Citing very little time to consider the document, many said their views were missing, with some suggesting that this document might not be acceptable as a basis for negotiations. 

Several indicated that their call for this COP to establish a facility was missing, which Cordano noted was under the title “Outcome of the ‘process’ up until 2024.” Others expressed concern with a footnote stating, among others, that the outcomes on this agenda item do not involve liability or compensation, include the Glasgow Dialogue, and will launch a process with a view to adopting a conclusive decision no later than 2024. They suggested this diverges from the agreement on the scope of this agenda item. Consultations will continue.

Guidance on Cooperative Approaches Referred to in Article 6.2: In informal consultations, Co-Chairs Kuki Soejachmoen (Indonesia) and Peer Stiansen (Norway) outlined a proposed schedule of work for the next two days under this item, based on text forwarded from SBSTA, starting with the agreed electronic format (AEF), Article 6 database, and centralized accounting and reporting platform (CARP). They noted “informal informal” timeslots available in the evenings. 

On the AEF, parties indicated their preferred options for information in tables on actions and holdings. Many lamented the difficulty of engaging with a PDF format. Parties diverged on the specificity of the required information, with one developing country group stressing the need for many countries to first test the tables’ usability given their insufficient prior experience in this area and suggesting approving the AEF provisionally at this CMA. Those favoring agreement at this CMA pointed out that some countries foresee using internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs) already in 2023 and that AEFs are needed to inform other components of the Article 6.2 reporting infrastructure.

Specific comments focused on, inter alia: interpretation of nomenclature under the heading “ITMO ID,” including the terms “ID” and “serial number”; streamlining and harmonizing nomenclature under “action type” and “sectors”; indicating mandatory and optional fields; and information and tracking of outcomes used towards other international mitigation purposes.

On the Article 6 database and CARP, parties proposed ways to advance work within the remaining time, including by dedicating further time for informal informals and identifying priority issues requiring decision at this CMA. Informal consultations will resume on Tuesday, 15 November.

Rules, Modalities and Procedures for the Mechanism Established by Article 6.4: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Kate Hancock (Australia) and Sonam Tashi (Bhutan) explained the CMA mandate for this week covers: the report of the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body (FCCC/PA/CMA/2022/6 and Add.1); and text forwarded from the Article 6.4 SBSTA discussions.

On the Supervisory Body’s recommendations, parties expressed support for the proposed rules of procedure and share of proceeds. On removals, parties, along with three observer groups, raised several concerns, calling for ensuring environmental integrity and aligning language on environmental and social safeguards and human and Indigenous Peoples’ rights with previous decisions. They also supported mandating the Body to work further on the recommendations and report back to CMA 5, and to: conduct this work jointly with that on related methodologies; undertake further stakeholder consultations and calls for submissions; and engage in further work on different removal types, reversals, leakage, and a grievance mechanism.

On other further work, groups called for ensuring the mechanism’s operationalization through requesting the Body to work on all relevant mandates, including methodologies, standardized baselines, Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) transition, and review of the CDM sustainable development tool. They also called for setting 2023 as the deadline to finalize this work and ensuring a dedicated support structure and sufficient funds.

Parties also briefly considered sections in the draft CMA decision text forwarded by SBSTA on the transition of CDM activities and on the use of certified emission reductions (CERs). Consultations will continue.

Work Programme under the Framework for Non-market Approaches Referred to in Article 6.8: In the contact group, Co-Chairs Maria Al-Jishi (Saudi Arabia) and Jacqueline Ruesga (New Zealand) explained the focus of work in the second week is to agree on remaining issues in the draft decision text forwarded from Article 6.8 SBSTA discussions. Deliberations then continued in informal consultations, with parties sharing views on sections on an implementation schedule for work programme activities, and inputs to the review of these activities in 2026.

On the schedule, the Co-Chairs shared their bridging proposals relating to: mandating a schedule for activities in 2023 and an indicative schedule for 2024-2026; removing labels for the proposed work programme periods; and mandating the CMA to provide input annually instead of a mid-term assessment of the programme. Parties expressed their views, including for and against the bridging proposals.

On inputs to the 2026 review, parties debated whether the section was necessary, with some suggesting references to “standard procedures” at this stage and deciding on specific guidance later.

The Co-Chairs encouraged parties to continue discussions in “informal informals” in the afternoon.

COP/CMA

Guidance to the Green Climate Fund (GCF): In informal consultations, Co-Chair Toru Sugio (Japan) sought parties’ comments on the texts circulated on Saturday, 12 November, which included draft decision texts for the COP and CMA. Several parties appreciated the Co-Chairs’ efforts but said the drafts need a lot of work, citing redundant or confusing paragraphs. Some developing and developed countries cautioned against an outcome that micromanages the GCF, is too top-down, or prejudges items being considered by the Board. A developing country raised a concern about unbalanced representation on the Board. A developing country group expressed concern about “gaslighting” on loss and damage and said the GCF is not currently structured to address it. Another developing country group proposed reflecting that financial flows should be from developed to developing countries. Responding to concerns that some parties were unable to intervene orally, Co-Chair Sugio requested written submissions for incorporation into the next iteration. Consultations will continue.

Report and Review of the Adaptation Committee: In informal consultations facilitated by SBSTA Chair Tosi Mpanu Mpanu (Democratic Republic of the Congo), the Chair noted that, in the SBs’ conclusions, parties agreed to work on the basis of the Saturday, 12 November, 6:00 pm draft text, which condensed 11 pages into one. He urged delegates not to propose new text but to work on the compromise text instead. Parties suggested textual insertions, including on: collaboration with the IPCC; reference to NDC common timeframes; and translations to enhance stakeholder engagement in the Committee’s activities. Several opposed a proposal by a developed country for the CMA to conclude its review of the Committee.

Chair Mpanu Mpanu will consult with the Presidency on the way forward, and urged parties meanwhile to discuss informally.

CMP

Report of the Adaptation Fund Board: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Diann Black-Layne (Antigua and Barbuda) and Eva Schreuder (Netherlands), countries heard views on the revised draft text circulated on Sunday, 13 November. One developed country reiterated its previous proposal to include “project approval” to “accreditation” in text on finding opportunities for streamlining processes, which a developing country group opposed, saying these are very different processes. One country offered as a compromise to consider a pilot in SIDS or LDCs that attempts to harmonize different funding processes to facilitate access to funding. A small group will explore this option. The Co-Facilitators will circulate new draft text.

Matters Relating to the Clean Development Mechanism: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Alick Muvundika (Zambia) and Kazuhiza Koakutsu (Japan), parties shared views on the first iteration of draft CMP decision text, issued on Sunday, 13 November, containing a placeholder for text forwarded from the SBSTA on CER transfers.

On the CMA decision, parties expressed diverging views regarding time frames for temporary and transition processes related to: CER issuance; methodology approvals, revisions or updates; and accreditation of operational entities. Some preferred setting specific dates, with others opposing. Meanwhile, some called for linking some of these processes to the operationalization of the Article 6.4 mechanism, and yet others suggested mandating the Secretariat to conduct technical work and deciding on these matters at CMP 18 in 2023.

Parties also diverged on whether to include afforestation and reforestation as activities subject to the temporary measures, and enable voluntary cancellations of post-2020 CERs.

The Co-Facilitators informed that they would issue a new iteration of text and encouraged parties to consult informally.

Matters Relating to the Forum on the Impact of the Implementation of Response Measures: In the informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Andrei Marcu (Papua New Guinea) and Daniel Waterschoot (EU) invited views on a draft decision text. Delegates focused on text addressing various “aspects” or “activities” relating to the midterm review of the forum. They agreed to discuss text on cross-cutting issues, regional issues, indicators and reporting, regional workshops, case studies, training, meetings, linkages with other matters, just transition, and impacts of phasing down coal power and phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.

Many differences persisted. Developed countries proposed deleting language on common but differentiated responsibilities in relation to human rights, opposed by developing countries. Developed countries sought the deletion of text on regional workshops and on more meeting days for the Katowice Committee of Experts (KCI). These deletions were opposed by developing countries. 

Developing countries suggested deleting text on indicators to track the impacts of the forum’s workplan, while several developed countries preferred retaining it. Discussions resumed informally later in the evening.

In the Corridors

Even with a week left, time is at a premium. The number of issues forwarded from the Subsidiary Bodies “might just be a record,” opined a long-time delegate. Adding to the usual raft of week-two topics, like finance, are thirteen Subsidiary Body issues covering the gamut of climate governance. While seemingly different, some noted a similar sticking point across the agenda items: finance and support more generally. Even in gender, often viewed as a less controversial issue, a debate about how to support developing countries sparked a difficult conversation that continues this week.

Facing this backlog of technical work, and with ministers now on site demanding progress before they engage in more political discussions, there were repeated calls for more time for negotiations. “Extra time” was found – in the evening and into the night.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Stiell had a different timeline on his mind, telling ministers that it is “time to face our collective fate” as they faced the state of mitigation efforts and the warmer, less secure world they will create.

      The first week of the Sharm El-Sheikh Climate Change Conference concluded with the closing plenaries of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI). Substantive conclusions were adopted on a limited number of issues, mostly related to the consideration of reports by constituted bodies and to reporting. On many issues, only procedural conclusions were adopted which noted that further work is required to finalize the relevant decisions.

COP

Long-term finance: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Carlos Fuller (Belize), parties welcomed the co-facilitators’ draft text, circulated the previous night along with a compilation of submissions and inputs received. They requested further streamlining of the text, including by using decision text from previous years.

Developing countries highlighted as important areas, inter alia, concern over gaps in fulfillment of pledges and between needs and delivery, and a common definition of climate finance. They also called for using agreed language and terminology, opposing, among others, references to “parties” and “donors,” noting the provision of finance is not a donation but a commitment. Many developing countries also opposed references to the Progress Report on the Climate Finance Delivery Plan, saying it comes from outside the UNFCCC process.

Developed and developing countries diverged on whether to mandate the Standing Committee on Finance (SCF) to prepare an annual report on the delivery of the USD 100 billion goal, with developed countries noting the reporting cycle under the Paris Agreement’s Enhanced Transparency Framework is biennial. In response to some developing countries opposing references to Paris Agreement Article 2.1(c) (on consistency of finance flows), two groups stated that an agreement had been reached in ministerial discussions in Glasgow to have an agenda item on this article, while recognizing that this item is not the right place for discussing this.

Discussions will continue in the second week, based on a co-facilitators’ revised draft text.

CMA

New collective quantified goal on climate finance: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Zaheer Fakir (South Africa) and Georg Børsting (Norway) shared that a compilation of parties’ submissions and in-session inputs for draft decision text had been made available, and invited comments on the co-facilitators’ proposed structure for the draft decision, including: past decisions; stocktake of progress; procedural elements, such as working modalities, participation, and submissions; and substantive elements, such as themes and topics to be addressed, and guidance for the high-level ministerial dialogue.

Parties expressed support for the proposed structure and mandated the co-facilitators to prepare a first draft decision text.

Developing countries underscored, inter alia: calling on developed countries to accelerate delivery of their finance goals; the level of the new goal; principles of the Convention; public and grant-based finance; balance between adaptation and mitigation finance; and transparency and accounting arrangements for tracking delivery.

Countries diverged on whether to agree on the modalities for the work programme under this item for 2023 only or also 2024. One identified a decision on the themes of the technical expert dialogues (TEDs) as an area requiring time in the second week.

Most parties agreed on the need to make the ministerial dialogues more interactive and focused on delivering political guidance for the technical process under the work programme. Others called for also revising the format of the TEDs to be more outcome-oriented.

Discussions will continue in the second week, based on the co-facilitators’ draft text.

COP/CMA

Matters relating to the Standing Committee on Finance: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Janine Felson (Belize) and Dominic Molloy (UK) invited parties to reflect on a text based on a compilation of submissions and inputs, shared earlier in the day. Parties reflected on paragraphs relating to: the Fifth Biennial Assessment and Overview of Climate Finance Flows; Paris Agreement Article 2.1(c); and climate finance definitions. Parties called for the co-facilitators to further streamline the text, including by removing duplication.

On the Biennial Assessment, parties shared views on elements and data, including quantitative information, to be highlighted in the decision. Some groups called for also referencing non-Paris Agreement aligned flows. Some called for referencing the recommendations from the SCF report (FCCC/CP/2022/8/Add.1−FCCC/PA/CMA/2022/7/Add.1).

Noting challenges relating to the SCF’s draft guidance for the Financial Mechanism’s operating entities, one developed country suggested removing this element from the Committee’s terms of reference. A developing country group opposed, calling for requesting the SCF instead to improve engagement with parties.

On Article 2.1(c), many called for a space for a dedicated discussion. Two developing country groups opposed references to the SCF’s mapping and synthesis of views, arguing they are not representative of all parties’ views and stressing the Article must be interpreted in the broader context of the Paris Agreement. One developing country group reiterated that it wishes to elevate the discussion on finance definitions to the political level.

Discussions will continue in the second week on the basis of a revised co-facilitators’ draft text.

Matters Relating to Funding Arrangements Responding to Loss and Damage Associated with the Adverse Effects of Climate Change, Including a Focus on Addressing Loss and Damage: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Ursula Fuentes (Germany), several developing country groups reiterated their call to establish a finance facility for loss and damage at COP 27/CMA 4 and set out a clear roadmap to ensure its full operationalization by 2024. Several also suggested establishing an ad hoc committee to guide the operationalization process, noting the need to give it a clear mandate and timeline, decide on its composition and modalities of work, and ensure sufficient budgetary provisions.

Several developed countries reiterated their acknowledgment of funding gaps, the diversity of challenges related to loss and damage, and the urgency to address the matter. They emphasized: building on existing initiatives; welcoming announcements of support; examining issues at the regional level; and prioritizing support for those most vulnerable.

Many envisioned the Glasgow Dialogue to provide the space to discuss specific issues, including slow-onset events, rapid response, the role of multilateral development banks (MDBs), and debt relief. One developing country group recalled similar work done over the past decade, pointing among others to extensive work done by the SCF.

Fuentes invited parties to share written versions of statements made during the session, noting these will be published on the UNFCCC website. Building on the views expressed by parties, the co-facilitators will prepare an overview of elements to be included in the decisions to be taken at COP 27/CMA 4.

SBSTA

Organizational Matters: Election of officers other than the Chair: SBSTA Chair Tosi Mpanu Mpanu (Democratic Republic of the Congo) reported that the Secretariat had received no nominations, therefore under Rule 22(2) of the UNFCCC’s draft Rules of Procedure, Kakhaberi Mdivani (Georgia) and Zita Kassa Wilks (Gabon) will continue to serve as Vice-Chair and Rapporteur, respectively, until their successors are elected at the next session.

Guidance on Cooperative Approaches Referred to in Article 6.2: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Kuki Soejachmoen (Indonesia) and Peer Stiansen (Norway) recalled that parties had asked for further time to consider the co-facilitators’ draft text containing draft procedural SBSTA conclusions, and a bracketed draft CMA decision, introduced the previous day. They reported that the Presidency had agreed to reflect, in the next iteration of the draft CMA decision, a paragraph on capacity building similar to the text on capacity building in the Article 6.4 draft. The co-facilitators asked if parties were willing to adopt the draft SBSTA conclusions and forward the draft CMA decision to the Presidency for continued consultations in the second week.

Most parties underlined that the draft CMA decision did not represent consensus, with several identifying missing elements, including in relation to review, infrastructure, and reporting. Parties agreed to the draft SBSTA conclusions and bracketed draft CMA decision as presented.

During its closing plenary, the SBSTA adopted conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2022/L.23). SBSTA Chair Mpanu Mpanu noted parties had not yet reached agreement on a draft decision on this item and said he would bring unresolved issues to the attention of the CMA President for his further guidance on next steps.

Rules, Modalities and Procedures for the Mechanism Established by Article 6.4: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Kate Hancock (Australia) introduced a new iteration of the draft text, containing procedural draft SBSTA conclusions and a draft CMA decision. She noted the conclusions contained a disclaimer clarifying that the decision text does not represent consensus and will require further work by the CMA in the second week. Parties agreed to the draft conclusions with the annexed draft decision text, as presented, to be forwarded to the SBSTA Chair.

In its closing plenary, the SBSTA adopted conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2022/L.21). Mpanu Mpanu noted parties had not yet reached agreement on a draft decision on this item and said he would bring unresolved issues to the attention of the CMA President for his further guidance on next steps.

Work Programme under the Framework for Non-market Approaches Referred to in Article 6.8: The SBSTA adopted conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2022/L.24). Mpanu Mpanu noted parties had not yet reached agreement on a draft decision on this item and said he will bring unresolved issues to the attention of the CMA President for his further guidance on next steps.

Closure of the SBSTA: Parties adopted the draft report of SBSTA 57 (FCCC/SBSTA/2022/L.17). Chair Mpanu Mpanu thanked all for “an extraordinary journey” at a critical time for the planet, and declared SBSTA 57 closed at 11:05 pm.

SBI

Organizational Matters: Election of officers other than the Chair: SBI Chair Marianne Karlsen (Norway) reported that the Secretariat had received no nominations, therefore under Rule 22(2) of the UNFCCC’s draft Rules of Procedure, Juan Carlos Monterrey Gómez (Panama) and Aysin Turpanci (Turkey) will remain in office as the SBI Vice-Chair and SBI Rapporteur, respectively, until their successors are elected at the next session.

Non-Annex I Reporting: Information contained in national communications: This item is held in abeyance. The item will be added to the provisional agenda of SB 58.

Subsidiary Bodies

The SBs considered joint items in a joint closing plenary.

Report of the Adaptation Committee: The SBs adopted conclusions (FCCC/SB/2022/L.13). The SB Chairs noted parties had not agreed on an outcome and they would bring this to the COP/CMA President’s attention for his guidance on next steps.

Glasgow-Sharm El-Sheikh Work Programme on the Global Goal on Adaptation: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Mattias Frumerie (Sweden) and Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago), parties heard a report back from informal informals, noting increasing convergence around a developing country group’s proposed framework, the elements of which are proposed to be elaborated in the 2023 workshops. Several developing country groups and parties expressed support for the proposal and underscored the need for a substantive outcome at SB 57. A developed country opposed, citing insufficient time to consider it. Other parties shared views on a co-facilitators’ draft text, including on elements under the option for a framework.

A developing country group urged for its submissions to be reflected in the text, and another suggested forwarding all conference room papers to the SB Chairs alongside the co-facilitators’ draft text.

A developing country group requested it be put on record that security prevented many groups from entering the room for over two-thirds of the session, despite there being empty seats. Points of order ensued.

The co-facilitators informed they would forward procedural conclusions to the SB Chairs, noting parties could not reach agreement.

In their joint closing plenary, the SBs adopted conclusions (FCCC/SB/2022/L.15). The SB Chairs noted parties had not agreed on an outcome and that they would bring this to the CMA President’s attention for his guidance on next steps. PAKISTAN lamented parties’ inability to advance work under this item at the SBs, urging all to continue working constructively to reach common ground.

Report of the Executive Committee (ExCom) of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts (WIM): The SBs adopted conclusions containing a draft COP and CMA decision (FCCC/SB/2022/L.11).

Matters Relating to the Santiago Network under the WIM: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Lucas di Pietro (Argentina) and Cornelia Jäger (Austria) presented draft procedural conclusions noting that the SBs continued, but did not conclude, consideration of matters under this agenda item and agreed to forward the matter to COP 27 and CMA 4 for further guidance, taking into account the co-facilitators’ informal note. Parties disagreed on whether to refer to “governing body or bodies” or name a particular body or bodies, and if so, which. They also debated whether to include a footnote noting that discussions on the governance of the WIM are ongoing, which could provide assurances that this would be subject to the Presidency’s ongoing consultations on WIM governance.

In their closing plenary, the SBs adopted conclusions (FCCC/SB/2022/L.17). The SB Chairs noted parties had not agreed on an outcome and they would bring this to the COP and/or CMA President’s attention for his guidance on next steps.

Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture: The SBs adopted conclusions (FCCC/SB/2022/L.9). The SB Chairs noted parties had not agreed on an outcome and they would bring this to the COP President’s attention for his guidance on next steps.

Matters Relating to the Work Programme for Urgently Scaling up Mitigation Ambition and Implementation: Co-Facilitators Carlos Fuller (Belize) and Kay Harrison (New Zealand) introduced draft text containing draft SB conclusions, a bracketed draft CMA decision, and an annex to the CMA decision on the thematic areas of the work programme. They invited parties’ comments on the text.

Many parties expressed willingness to agree to the SB conclusions and forward the draft CMA decision for further consultations during the second week. One developing country group said the draft conclusions should reflect that the draft CMA decision and its annex have not achieved consensus and are not ready to be adopted.

Several countries identified missing elements from the text which they wanted reflected before they could accept it as the basis for further work, including referencing exact language from the Paris Agreement in relation to the temperature goal, and deleting “vulnerable developing countries” from the text and using agreed language instead. One party called for clarity on how the work programme would deliver on its mandate, noting the need to be more than a “talk shop.” Another party proposed establishing a cross-sectoral just transitions financing framework.

One developed country underlined its request to capture, factually, the current status of emissions and the countries that can contribute the most to emission reductions. One developing country group called for including, in the annex, reference to carbon capture and storage and carbon dioxide removal technologies, and, in the preamble to the draft CMA decision, text stating that “human-induced climate change is a consequence of more than a century of net greenhouse emissions.”

A developed country expressed its wish to keep a space in the informal consultations to discuss some of the political elements around mitigation, pending clarity regarding the Presidency’s consultations on the cover decisions.

The co-facilitators informed they would produce revised draft text based on parties’ comments and forward it to the SB Chairs for consideration at the closing plenaries.

In their closing plenary, the SBs adopted conclusions (FCCC/SB/2022/ L.14). The SB Chairs noted parties had not agreed on an outcome and they would bring this to the CMA President’s attention for his guidance on next steps.

Matters Relating to the Global Stocktake: The SBs adopted conclusions (FCCC/SB/2022/L.8).

Development and Transfer of Technologies: Joint report of the Technology Executive Committee and Climate Technology Centre and Network: The SBs adopted two sets of conclusions, one containing a draft COP decision (FCCC/SB/2022/L.12), and the other containing a draft CMA decision (FCCC/SB/2022/L.16). CHILE expressed concern over the exclusion of some countries from the Adaptation Fund Climate Innovation Accelerator.

Matters Relating to the Forum on the Impact of the Implementation of Response Measures: The SBs adopted conclusions (FCCC/SB/2022/L.10). The SB Chairs noted parties had not agreed on an outcome and that they would bring this to the COP/CMP/CMA President’s attention for his guidance on next steps.

Second periodic review of the long-term global goal under the Convention and of overall progress towards achieving it: The SBs adopted conclusions (FCCC/SB/2022/L.18). The SB Chairs noted parties had not agreed on an outcome and they would bring this to the COP President’s attention for his guidance on next steps.

Closing Statements

Thanking the outgoing SB Chairs Mpanu Mpanu and Karlsen for their work over the past three years, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell reprimanded parties for leaving too many issues still unresolved, saying “if we create a logjam in the process, we will not create an outcome that is deserving of this process.” He called on parties to convene and close their work as soon as possible to achieve an ambitious outcome from this conference.

Pakistan, for the G-77/CHINA, called for an ambitious outcome on finance, underlined the group’s objective of a technology implementation work programme, and expressed disappointment that all efforts to seek implementation of national adaptation plans (NAPs) had been objected to by their partners. The EU looked forward to progressing work in the second week of the Conference. Switzerland, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, expressed the group’s appreciation to the SB Chairs for their hard work.

Australia, for AUSTRALIA, CANADA, JAPAN, ICELAND, ISRAEL, NEW ZEALAND, NORWAY, UKRAINE, and the US, expressed disappointment at parties’ inability to reach conclusions on many items and urged all parties to cooperate to make progress on issues.

Zambia, for the AFRICAN GROUP, called for COP 27 to deliver on scaling up adaptation action and support, including through the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) and, on loss and damage funding arrangements, a decision establishing a new operating entity of the Financial Mechanism.

Antigua and Barbuda, for the ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES, urged a more structured approach for 2023 under the GGA, highlighting the group’s proposal in this regard.

Senegal, for the LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCs), underlined that the mitigation work programme should facilitate the mobilization of resources for the implementation of action in LDCs, and called for support for NAP implementation.

Bolivia, for the LIKE-MINDED GROUP OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, expressed concern about ongoing climate injustice, lamenting developed countries’ attempts to shift the burden of addressing climate change to developing countries, the private sector, and MDBs.

Colombia, for the INDEPENDENT ALLIANCE OF LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN, regretted the lack of substantive agreement on important items but said the group will keep expectations high, and expressed willingness to engage constructively.

Venezuela, for the BOLIVARIAN ALLIANCE FOR THE PEOPLES OF OUR AMERICA, called on developed countries to deliver on the USD 100 billion commitment, adopt decisive measures to significantly increase this figure to cover climate finance needs, and honor their adaptation debt. He emphasized the importance of non-market approaches (NMAs) and of implementing a loss and damage finance mechanism as soon as possible.

Brazil, for ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, and URUGUAY, expressed deep concern about loss and damage discussions and called for progress, particularly on: establishing a loss and damage finance facility; the Santiago Network; the GGA; Article 6; and the mitigation work programme.

Saudi Arabia, for the ARAB GROUP, highlighted the importance of balance in both the negotiations and the outcomes, and expressed concern with the lack of progress in adaptation and mitigation discussions.

MALDIVES defined success as: a cover decision that keeps 1.5°C alive; a robust GGA; loss and damage funding from all available sources; and transformation of the entire financial system.

BOLIVIA underscored climate action should benefit all living beings and protect the rights of Mother Earth. She called for full operationalization of NMAs and for a balance in the consultations on cooperative implementation (Article 6).

CHILE and the UK thanked the SB Chairs for the support given during their respective COP presidencies.

RESEARCH AND INDEPENDENT NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (RINGOs) called for taking into account social sciences and recommendations by researchers of the Global South in the design of climate policies.

WOMEN AND GENDER expressed disappointment with the review process of the gender action plan, saying it rolled back on progressive language on human rights and equality.

CHILDREN AND YOUTH NGOs called for inclusion of youth in transparency reporting and review processes and shaping the GGA, and for funding for youth-led climate projects.

BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY NGOs (BINGOs) stated that the global business community stands behind the goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and described limiting global warming to 1.5°C as imperative.

Climate Action Network, for ENVIRONMENTAL NGOS, called for a delivery plan for doubling adaptation finance, and said it is unacceptable to restrict the cover decision to elements from agenda items only.

FARMERS called for the “current Koronivia to end” and a new discussion to begin, with a discussion on practical implementation, saying farmers already have solutions but need financing and partnerships.

In the Corridors

“Well, at least it was rather swift,” noted a somber delegate, leaving the closing plenaries of the Subsidiary Bodies. Despite several interruptions due to technical issues with the UNFCCC website, the Bodies considered the outcomes of discussions on all their agenda items and heard reflections by parties and observers, “all in under four hours.”

However, “outcomes is an overstatement in this case,” opined an observer. The logjam of issues on which no substantive agreement could be found during the first week is impressive. At this point, no one is expecting a quick resolution of Article 6, evidently. But “what is the matter with national adaptation plans?” she asked.

In all likelihood, outstanding issues will be further discussed under the governing bodies in the second week. Yet many wondered about the Presidency’s notable absence from the closing plenaries. “I guess we’ll hear suggestions on the way forward on Monday,” offered a puzzled delegate, who hoped a day of rest would manage to transform the meeting from what he termed as “negotiating by submissions” towards the implementation COP it is being touted as.

      With the end of the first week of the Sharm El-Sheikh Climate Change Conference nearing, co-facilitators across many negotiation rooms reminded delegates of the need to conclude consideration of the items set to be forwarded to the closing plenaries of the Subsidiary Bodies (SBs), scheduled for the next day. 

COP/CMA

Guidance to the Green Climate Fund; Guidance to the Global Environment Facility: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Toru Sugio (Japan) and Richard Muyungi (Tanzania) invited parties to reflect on a compilation of submissions received from parties on guidance to the Green Climate Fund (GCF), starting with guidance from the COP. Sugio explained that a compilation of submissions on guidance for the Global Environment Facility (GEF) was being prepared. Many countries noted they had not yet received the GCF compilation, while others noted it had 125 paragraphs and was convoluted. Agreeing with the assessment, Sugio explained that parties had not yet provided the co-facilitators a mandate to prepare draft text. All parties agreed to mandate the co-facilitators to streamline the text, making specific suggestions on how to do this and highlighting their priority issues and “red lines.”

On suggestions for streamlining, parties requested removing: duplication; repetition in areas where guidance already exists; and elements contradicting the GCF Governing Instrument. A developing country group pointed out that parties’ understanding of what constitutes a contradiction with the Governing Instrument varies, with a developed country suggesting the co-facilitators focus on paragraphs most likely to achieve consensus.

On priorities and red lines, many developed countries called for keeping the guidance at a high, strategic level and avoiding micromanaging the GCF Board, including on issues already decided or under consideration, or preempting the quantity of the second GCF replenishment. Countries called for inclusion of, inter alia, gender considerations, access policies, complementarity with other institutions, and REDD+. One developing country group cautioned against including guidance that reinterprets the UNFCCC or its principles. A developing country opposed language on just transitions. Several developed countries called for GCF-related elements discussed under other items, including loss and damage and national adaptation plans, to be centralized under this item.

On a compilation of submissions for CMA guidance, parties provided the co-facilitators a similar streamlining mandate. They disagreed on whether and how to include guidance relating to Paris Agreement Article 2.1(c) (on consistency of finance flows). Muyungi explained that compilations of GEF guidance submissions would be available on Saturday morning, 12 November, and the co-facilitators would endeavor to provide draft text for both entities by the end of the first week.

Matters Relating to Funding Arrangements Responding to Loss and Damage Associated with the Adverse Effects of Climate Change, Including a Focus on Addressing Loss and Damage: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Julio Cordano (Chile) noted that parties had made important progress in sharing general expectations, and invited a focus on: elements for the outcome from COP 27/CMA 4; timeline for work through 2024; potential work under the SBs; and the role of the Glasgow Dialogue on loss and damage.

On elements for the outcome, developing countries listed, inter alia: acknowledgement of the gap between needs and support; new, additional, and adequate financing; and creating an operational entity and “a series of conversations to develop the details of this entity.”

On the timeline and work for the SBs, a developed country suggested mandating the SBI to implement the work programme under this item and report on its progress, and that a decision be taken at the COP/CMA in 2024. Another developed country suggested mandating SB discussions on this item.

On the role of the Glasgow Dialogue, developed countries made various suggestions, including: considering the current loss and damage support landscape, including how relevant institutions can provide support, coordinating these actors, and identifying gaps and ways to address these gaps; and mapping potential sources of funding. They proposed technical papers, further workshops, national and regional meetings, ministerial roundtables, submissions, inputs from initiatives being established in and outside the UNFCCC, and special and annual reports to the COP/CMA. One developed country said that form should follow function, calling for “time to get it right” while recognizing the urgency of the matter.

Developing countries observed that developed countries’ proposals seemed to contradict the sense of urgency they proclaimed, noting that discussions have been ongoing for more than a decade and calling for a political decision to create a fund for loss and damage.

Informal consultations will continue on Saturday, 12 November.

CMP

Report of the Adaptation Fund Board: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Diann Black-Layne (Antigua and Barbuda) and Eva Schreuder (Netherlands), parties diverged on whether to welcome and name parties that had made pledges, regardless of whether they had signed contribution agreements, or welcome all announced pledges but note those still outstanding. Calling this an accountability issue, a developing country group, supported by others, preferred either the latter option or, as an alternative, simply omitting the names of parties with announced but outstanding pledges. They also exchanged views on whether to specify a preference for pledges to the Fund to be “multi-annual” and an invitation for voluntary contributions from non-party stakeholders. On text relating to opportunities for streamlining processes, a developed country proposed adding “project approval” to the scope. A developing country group opposed, noting accreditation and project approval processes are very different and including the latter would be inappropriate. The co-facilitators will circulate revised text. 

SBI

Fourth Review of the Adaptation Fund: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Black-Layne and Schreuder described changes to the draft text compared to the previous iteration, including: adding, in a preambular paragraph, a reference to the importance of share of proceeds; and noting that the previous resource mobilization strategy is the first to refer to funding by subnational governments, the private sector, and charitable foundations.

Parties strongly diverged on the level of participation accorded to countries that are parties to the Paris Agreement but not the Kyoto Protocol in the decision-making discussions on this agenda item. The Secretariat’s legal advisor confirmed several developing country groups’ and countries’ interpretation that non-parties cannot participate in decision making and therefore cannot make interventions on CMP decision text to be forwarded to the SBI plenary unless the interventions are channeled through parties.

Parties also debated whether to: include references to Decision 1/CMA.3 paragraph 18, on doubling developed countries’ provision of climate finance for adaptation to developing countries; and note “with deep concern” the continued issues related to the sustainability, adequacy, and predictability of financial contributions to the Fund. On the upcoming fifth review of the Fund, after lengthy exchanges, parties agreed to request the SBI to report back to “its governing bodies” at COP 31 (2026) without specifying which bodies these are.

Other outstanding points could not be addressed and the co-facilitators noted they will forward the draft text incorporating agreed amendments to the SBI Chair.

Matters Relating to the Clean Development Mechanism Registry: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Kate Hancock (Australia) and Sonam Tashi (Bhutan), parties reviewed co-facilitators’ draft text on this item, issued on Wednesday, 9 November.

In addition to editorial suggestions, comments focused on two paragraphs. On a paragraph clarifying that only certified emission reductions (CERs) held in permanent holding accounts may be transferred to the Article 6.4 mechanism registry, one developing country group viewed that CERs from pending accounts should also be eligible. Parties agreed to delete this paragraph.

On a sub-paragraph on transfer requests requiring approval from the host party of the CER-generating activity, parties discussed whether host parties should “approve” or “inform,” which entity should play this role, and whether they should also approve the CERs’ use. Hancock proposed additional language to clarify the approving authority and CERs’ use toward nationally determined contributions (NDCs). 

Noting a lack of consensus on this sub-paragraph, the co-facilitators informed parties they will prepare a new text iteration to reflect consensus on other paragraphs and consult the SBI Chair on the way forward.

Reporting and Review Pursuant to Article 13 of the Paris Agreement: Provision of financial and technical support to developing countries for reporting and capacity-building: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Tian Wang (China) and Helen Plume (New Zealand), parties considered draft conclusions, engaging in textual negotiations on a number of paragraphs. 

A developing country group called for the SBI to urge the GEF to at least double the resources it provides for biennial transparency reports and provide no less than USD 1 million per country. Several developed countries pointed to lengthy negotiations on the GEF’s eight replenishment and noted the matter should be taken up in the negotiations on guidance to the GEF.

Several developed countries cautioned against preempting the outcome of the continued consideration of challenges that developing countries face in implementing the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF) at SBI 58 and opposed references to a long-term workplan. Parties converged on specifying this be done with a view to facilitating the development of sustainable institutional capacity of developing countries, particularly least developed countries and small island developing states, to meet their obligations under Paris Agreement Article 13 (on transparency).

Other amendments related to noting capacity gaps in establishing and enhancing reporting systems, and noting existing support provided through multilateral and bilateral channels. 

The co-facilitators said they will forward the draft text incorporating agreed amendments to the SBI Chair.

SBSTA

Guidance on Cooperative Approaches Referred to in Article 6.2: Co-Facilitators Kuki Soejachmoen (Indonesia) and Peer Stiansen (Norway) introduced new draft text containing draft procedural SBSTA conclusions and a bracketed draft CMA decision containing guidance on the Article 6.2 cooperative approaches. Many parties noted they had not had the opportunity to consider the text and suggested holding informal informals on the draft CMA decision to try and achieve further convergence.

Discussions continued in informal informals.

Rules, Modalities, and Procedures for the Article 6.4 Mechanism: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Tashi and Hancock noted parties had completed a reading of sections of a co-facilitators’ draft text on: transition of Clean Development Mechanism activities; use of CERs towards first NDCs; and host party reporting. They invited comments on the remaining sections and the cover section of the decision.

On the operation of the mechanism registry, parties identified their positions, and made suggestions regarding the registry’s form and functions, transaction procedures, information functions, and interoperability with the Article 6.2 registry. Noting a divergence in views on the roles and functions of the two registries, including with regard to accounting, tracking, and nomenclature, several groups and parties stressed linkages to registry discussions under Article 6.2. Many proposed either waiting for clarity under Article 6.2 discussions or using flowcharts or other visual aids to map the relationships between different elements under discussion, in an informal setting. Parties also exchanged views on treatment and use of, and procedures for, non-authorized units.

On shares of proceeds for administrative expenses and adaptation, parties generally agreed with the text.

On delivering overall mitigation in global emissions (OMGE), parties expressed views on how to reorganize the section, with one developing country group stressing the need to clarify that voluntary cancellation is additional, and not alternative, to mandatory cancellation. Some stressed there is no OMGE for non-authorized units or CERs. One developing country suggested deleting the section on the basis that the decision from Glasgow on this item already provides sufficient guidance.

On the cover section, parties suggested additional elements, including relating to the Secretariat’s capacity-building programme, and made reservations regarding elements still to be added. One country called for bracketing the entire text, noting a similar level of progress was not taking place on all Article 6 items at this session.

The co-facilitators will produce a new iteration of the text and ask the SBSTA Chair for guidance on the next steps.

Work Programme under the Framework for Non-market Approaches Referred to in Article 6.8:  In the contact group, Co-Chairs Maria Al-Jishi (Saudi Arabia) and Jacqueline Ruesga (New Zealand) introduced new draft text containing draft SBSTA conclusions and a bracketed draft CMA decision on matters relating to the schedule for implementing the activities of the work programme under the framework for Article 6.8 non-market approaches (NMAs). They explained the draft CMA decision reflects possible convergence based on parties’ comments, and that the draft SBSTA conclusions text: captures the work of the Glasgow Committee on NMAs, as well as the progress and outcomes of the work programme; and specifies that there is no consensus on the draft CMA decision.

Bolivia, for the LIKE-MINDED GROUP OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (LMDCs), noted that following informal informals the previous night, the group had submitted a proposal to the Secretariat and requested that this proposal be included in the draft CMA decision as a second option in addition to the text prepared by the Co-Chairs. Most parties opposed including this proposal on the grounds that they had not received or considered it. Switzerland, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP (EIG), noted the LMDC proposal can still be considered by parties without it being included in the draft text. The EU suggested mentioning in the draft conclusions that a party had submitted a proposal which is not reflected in the text. The LMDCs agreed that the SBSTA conclusions can reference their proposal. The contact group will reconvene on Saturday.

Reviews on a Voluntary Basis of Information Reported Pursuant to Decision 18/CMA.1, Annex, Chapter IV, and Training Courses Needed: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Julia Gardiner (Australia), parties discussed outstanding issues in a draft decision text. They converged on deciding that the voluntary review also facilitates improvement of reporting by identifying, in consultation with the reporting party, areas of improvement and capacity-building needs related to reporting. On a request for the Secretariat to develop the training course for the reviewers, parties agreed to include references to Decision 5/CMA.3, paragraphs 33 and 34, related to timeframes for the development of training programmes and to geographical and gender balance among experts participating in the training. 

They also agreed to undertake the review of the training course in the context of the review of the modalities, procedures, and guidelines for the ETF no later than 2028 and consider integrating into the training programme the outcomes from the Global Goal on Adaptation work programme. Parties removed remaining brackets around text related to the recognition of flexibility and to encouraging the provision of financial resources on a voluntary basis.

With these amendments, parties agreed to the draft SBSTA conclusions and draft CMA decision, which will be forwarded to the SBSTA plenary.

Emissions from fuel used for international aviation and maritime transport: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Martin Cames (Germany) and Pacifica Achieng Ogola (Kenya), parties debated three options for draft conclusions. Options one and two take note of the submissions by the International Civil Aviation Organization and International Maritime Organization, thank the organizations for their clarifications, and invite them to continue reporting to the SBSTA. Option one also included an in-session workshop. Option three was no text. 

Parties converged on option two and worked to ensure it was a procedural conclusion that would include further discussion of this issue at the next SBSTA session.

Subsidiary Bodies

Glasgow–Sharm El-Sheikh Work Programme on the Global Goal on Adaptation: Informal consultations, co-facilitated by Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago), first heard comments on work in 2022 and on the 2023 work programme. Considering time, Kumarsingh noted some parties had submitted conference room papers (CRPs) but urged parties to engage on the co-facilitators’ draft joint SB conclusions and elements for a draft CMA decision. 

A developing country group, opposed by some developed countries, sought to include its entire CRP as a bracketed option for the draft CMA decision. Some parties shared views on the co-facilitators’ drafts.  On the draft CMA decision, parties commented on: an optional section entitled “Framework” capturing developing country groups’ proposals; the timing, themes, and concept notes for the 2023 workshops; engagement of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; and inputs to the GST. Several developed countries reiterated their opposition to including a framework in the draft decision, citing insufficient time during this SB session to find agreement on such substantive text. 

Informal informals convened in the evening.

Matters Relating to the Work programme for Urgently Scaling up Mitigation Ambition and Implementation: Co-Facilitators Carlos Fuller (Belize) and Kay Harrison (New Zealand) invited parties to continue to comment on the draft text, following informal informals the previous night.

Parties provided their preferences on elements of the work programme, such as: length, organization, and frequency of workshops; submissions; selection of thematic areas; and outcomes.

One developing country group, supported by others, opposed attempts to create a new category of developing countries, such as “major emitters,” pointing out that the work programme is under the Convention which has clearly set out and agreed principles. They stated that if the new iteration of text includes such reference, it would not engage further in discussions and would rather defer consideration of the agenda item under Rule 16 of the UNFCCC draft Rules of Procedure. In response to calls to base action on science, some countries suggested that action should be based on the science of historical emissions.

Several countries underlined that the text must maintain the nationally determined nature of countries’ NDCs and must not facilitate introduction of new targets. Many developed countries opposed including a “principles” section and suggested alternatively simply referring to the Paris Agreement.

Several developing countries, opposed by developed countries, supported retaining reference to the need for a fair and equitable distribution of the remaining carbon budget in line with the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities (CDBR), and calling for developed country parties to take the lead in implementing the work programme.

The co-facilitators urged parties to focus on technical, not political, issues.

Matters Relating to the Forum on the Impact of the Implementation of Response Measures: In informal consultations in the morning, Co-Facilitators Andrei Marcu (Papua New Guinea) and Daniel Waterschoot (EU) invited views on a draft decision text. Parties debated the mode of work, with developing countries urging discussing the workplan of the forum to inform its review and requesting additional time for discussions on the agenda item. Several developed countries suggested going through the draft decision and taking up paragraphs linked to the midterm review at the end, with one noting the review serves to assess progress to date, not add new activities. Some noted more time had already been allocated for this agenda item than for many others. Discussions continued in the afternoon.

Matters Related to the Global Stocktake: Contact group Co-Chairs Alison Campbell (UK) and Hana Al-Hashimi (United Arab Emirates) introduced draft conclusions and noted the objective to agree on a plan for 2023 to achieve the desired outcomes of the first GST. They urged parties to raise only red lines. 

Responding to the G-77/CHINA, the Co-Chairs clarified that time zones would be considered in planning intersessional consultations in hybrid format, and developing countries could seek financial support to attend in person. Noting this clarification, Trinidad and Tobago, for ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), supported the text. 

CANADA, COLOMBIA, the EU, and Brazil, for ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, and URUGUAY (ABU), commented on two paragraphs, on: parties’ submission of views on the approach to “the consideration of outputs” component of the first GST for consideration at SB 58; and the preparation of an information note and the holding of an intersessional consultation and intersessional in-person workshop, and their associated timelines. Considering diverging views, the Co-Chairs invited interested parties to a huddle. 

The Co-Chairs indicated they will revise the text based on discussions held in the huddle and aim to identify a supplementary time slot to reconvene the contact group.

Matters Relating to the Santiago network under the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts (WIM): In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Lucas di Pietro (Argentina) and Cornelia Jäger (Austria) introduced new draft text, noting it contains two annexes: on the Terms of Reference of the Santiago Network; and the criteria to select the host of the Network’s Secretariat. They invited comments on the draft.

Parties discussed the need for flexibility so countries can choose how they interact with the Network: through a national loss and damage contact point; UNFCCC national focal points; or another authority. 

Parties underscored the need to enable direct access to technical assistance but disagreed on whether proposals for such assistance can only be submitted by contact points or by any organization, body, network, or expert. They further discussed the roles of the contact points, including as “information repeaters” to spread information about the Network and the technical assistance available.

Informal informals convened in the evening.

Mandated Event

Second Meeting of the Technical Dialogue of the First Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement: The Co-Chairs of the technical dialogue of the first Global Stocktake (GST), Harald Winkler (South Africa) and Farhan Akhtar (US), moderated the closing plenary. Many delegates commended the format of the technical dialogue, praising the world café setting and the active engagement with non-party stakeholders. Some parties, particularly developing countries, noted that holding multiple breakout sessions affected the ability of small delegations to participate effectively in the process.

Parties highlighted some of their key takeaways from the process. The EU welcomed efforts to start narrowing down opportunities to enhance mitigation implementation. Switzerland, for the EIG, outlined questions that need to be answered, including how to scale up practices and experiences for accelerated implementation, and how to make these effective in phasing down unabated coal and removing fossil fuel subsidies.

Trinidad and Tobago, for AOSIS, expressed concern that the technical dialogue’s focus questions were too broad and that the resulting synthesis report may not produce the type of key messages desired. Saudi Arabia, for the LMDCs, underlined the importance of an equitable distribution of the carbon budget based on the total carbon budget. Algeria, for the ARAB GROUP, stressed a just and fair transition cannot be accomplished without maintaining political space for sustainable development, noting fossil fuel subsidy phasedown requires alternatives to be available.

NORWAY urged a systemic approach considering the entire value chain from production and planning to consumption, to create a seamless transition to low- or zero-emission societies. INDIA stressed that although science is not bound by political considerations of equity and CBDR, the GST is bound by, and must consider, these principles; and must therefore not make recommendations based on inequitable pathways.

RESEARCH AND INDEPENDENT NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (RINGOs) highlighted the process must be informed by the best available science, including Indigenous, traditional and local knowledge. TRADE UNION NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS  (TUNGOs) underlined the GST must consider if the NDC approach is delivering the desired goals. WOMEN AND GENDER lamented the “hyping” of private sector engagement and called for a focus on the responsibility of the public sector.

In the Corridors

Amidst the constant buzz of air conditioners and airplanes flying over the Sharm El-Sheikh Climate Change Conference venue, there was also a productive hum as negotiators sought to agree on as many conclusions and draft decisions as possible in time for the SB closing plenaries the following evening. As the day went by and co-facilitators’ pleas for compromise were left unheeded, late night sessions mushroomed on the schedule. 

Despite good progress on many items, views were somewhat divided on whether slower progress on others was due to the technical complexity, political sensitivity, or perhaps insufficient negotiating time given to issues. “For some issues it seems to be a matter of principle to drag things out” commented a seasoned observer. For others it might have helped to give co-facilitators a bolder mandate to streamline text.

In the background, delegations with pet issues in need of a home were getting ready to haggle over the cover decision. “It seems cover decisions are here to stay, so we might as well use them strategically,” reflected a delegate. “Whatever happened to the Presidency consultations on the proposed agenda items that did not make it to the agenda on day 1?” wondered another, noting it has been “awfully quiet.”

The US, on the other hand, was a much less quiet presence. President Joe Biden and his security staff took over plenary and US negotiators proved “far too vocal” for the taste of some in the negotiations on the Adaptation Fund. “We should not let them just come and go as they please,” stated an unamused delegate.

      On the fifth day of the Sharm El-Sheikh Climate Change Conference, the negotiations schedule was filled to the brim. Negotiators met throughout the day and into the night to discuss various finance-related issues, cooperative implementation under the Paris Agreement (Article 6), and scaling up mitigation ambition and implementation, among others.

COP

Long-term Climate Finance: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Gertraud Wollansky (Austria), parties expressed regret that the Standing Committee on Finance (SCF) could not agree on an executive summary for its report on the USD 100 billion goal (FCCC/CP/2022/8/Add.2). 

Developing countries called for a substantive decision on this item, including references to: achieving a balance between mitigation and adaptation finance; and raising the share of resources channeled through the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism. Several developing countries called for clarifying the methodologies used for tracking progress, while several developed countries highlighted the biennial assessment and overview of climate finance flows as the key source. 

One developing country called for an accountability process to identify which developed countries are failing to fulfill their commitments, and underscored that the lack of predictability and inadequate levels of support, and not the lack of projects, is the issue. Other points raised related to: trends in bilateral adaptation finance; ensuring progression; and considering finance received. Several groups and parties cautioned against duplication of work, noting that discussions on Paris Agreement Article 2.1(c) (on consistency of finance flows) and definitions of climate finance should be conducted under the SCF agenda item.

Co-Facilitator Wollansky invited parties’ submissions by noon on Friday, 11 November, to inform the preparation of draft text.

Seventh Review of the Financial Mechanism: In preliminary statements during informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Ricardo Marshall (Barbados) and Kelly Sharp (Canada) noted the Presidency will hold consultations on the role of the CMA with respect to the review. A developing country group, supported by others, underscored that those consultations are only procedural—limited to considering the US proposal to add the seventh review of the Financial Mechanism to the CMA agenda—and that the Presidency has no mandate to consult on substantive issues relating to this. Debates ensued on the scope of the Presidency’s mandate.

Parties strongly diverged on the substantive question of whether the CMA should take part in the review. Two developing country groups underscored that the Financial Mechanism serves the needs of developing countries, and that the review takes place under the Convention, not the Paris Agreement. Several other countries underscored the CMA should be part of the review.

The co-facilitators will consult the Presidency on the way forward.

COP/CMA

Standing Committee on Finance: Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Janine Felson (Belize) and Dominic Molloy (UK). 

Several developing countries underscored the need for a common definition of climate finance, while several developed countries considered the overview of operational definitions provided by the SCF to be sufficient and favored concluding consideration of the matter.

Many countries supported continuous engagement of the SCF on Paris Agreement Article 2.1(c), including with regard to tracking and metrics. One developing country underscored 2.1(c) has not been properly contextualized, pointing to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Another developing country group highlighted 2.1(c) relates to low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development pathways, but not directly to the 1.5°C target.

The co-facilitators will prepare draft text.

Matters Relating to Funding Arrangements Responding to Loss and Damage Associated with the Adverse Effects of Climate Change, Including a Focus on Addressing Loss and Damage: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Ursula Fuentes (Germany) and Julio Cordano (Chile), parties continued sharing their views on elements to include in a decision. 

There was broad acknowledgement of the gap between needs and availability of loss and damage finance and the urgency to address this, especially with regard to funding for addressing loss and damage, which refers to ex-post action. Many pointed to existing processes and initiatives outside the UNFCCC targeting loss and damage, which was met with some developing countries cautioning against diverting attention and emphasizing that any adopted solution should conform to UNFCCC principles.

Views differed as to the desired nature of the funding arrangements. Several developing country groups called for a stand-alone facility. Several developed countries pointed to a range of options, including a dedicated loss and damage window under the Green Climate Fund (GCF), Global Environment Facility, or Adaptation Fund, and other mechanisms such as risk insurance facilities and bilateral support.

Several developing countries urged establishing a facility at COP 27/CMA 4. Developed countries expressed they envision a process concluding in 2024, which provides a space to map the current landscape, assess gaps, dive into issues such as non-economic losses and slow-onset events. They suggested the Glasgow Dialogue contributes to this process.

CMA

Rules, Modalities and Procedures for the Mechanism Established by Article 6.4: In the contact group, Co-Chairs Kate Hancock (Australia) and Sonam Tashi (Bhutan) invited parties to share views on elements to be reflected in a CMA decision, including regarding the report by the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body on its first months of operation and recommendations on its rules of procedure, share of proceeds, and activities involving removals (FCCC/PA/CMA/2022/6 and Add.1). Hancock noted that a draft decision text was still being considered under the SBSTA.

Parties commended the Supervisory Body, noting the short time available for the Body to advance work in 2022. The EU and UK raised concerns about the absence of baselines and additionality guidance, and ARGENTINA, BRAZIL and URUGUAY (ABU) urged the Supervisory Body to start revising CDM methodologies to enable promotion of early action.

Many identified the need to prioritize, and provide timelines for, the issues the CMA mandates the Supervisory Body to work on in 2023, with the AFRICAN GROUP calling for ensuring a balance in operationalizing Articles 6.2 and 6.4.

Parties shared principles that should guide work under Article 6.4. The EU, Switzerland, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP (EIG), and the LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCs) stressed, inter alia, ensuring a contribution to closing the ambition gap, alignment with the Paris Agreement, and environmental integrity.

Several parties welcomed the Supervisory Body’s recommendations for its rules of procedure, and the levels for the share of proceeds for administrative expenses of the Article 6.4 mechanism.

On the recommendations on removals, ABU raised concerns about “vagueness” of the text and its “silence” on important issues, such as safeguards, including dealing with reversals, and noted extensive experience already acquired under the UNFCCC on removals. SAINT KITTS AND NEVIS expressed concern on the lack of differentiation between different removal types.

Several groups and parties requested continued work on removals at CMA 4, including time for group coordination, and dedicated submissions and discussions, with Saudi Arabia, for the LIKE-MINDED GROUP OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (LMDCs), and SAINT KITTS AND NEVIS suggesting mandating the Supervisory Body to continue work on the recommendations.

New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Zaheer Fakir (South Africa) and Georg Børsting (Norway) invited parties’ views on what should be captured in a decision. There was broad agreement that the technical expert dialogues (TEDs) should focus on specific topics and be more outcome-focused, with logistical details such as timing and location set early on to enhance the participation of experts. Two countries suggested holding mini-TEDs at the regional level. 

Several countries called for better capturing progress in the discussions and identifying areas of convergence, such as that the goal should feature quantitative and qualitative elements as well as sub-targets. 

In terms of themes for TEDs in 2023, suggestions included: the number of sub-goals; links between quantitative and qualitative elements of the goal; tracking methodologies; the specific vulnerabilities of LDCs and small island developing states; Paris Agreement Article 2.1(c) (on consistency of finance flows); broadening the contributor base; and challenges experienced by contributors and recipients.

Developing countries called for discussing the balance between mitigation and adaptation finance. They said the goal should also address loss and damage, and noted the need to reflect on the growing percentage of funding labeled as cross-cutting in the context of discussions on balanced funding allocation. One developed country said the quantum of the goal should be discussed in 2024, while a developing country considered the quantum as the most important aspect of the goal.

The co-facilitators invited parties’ submissions to inform the preparation of draft decision text, and indicated the CMA 4 Presidency is preparing a summary of the high-level discussions on the new goal held on Wednesday, 9 November, which will inform discussions at the next informal consultations.

Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI)

Fourth Review of the Adaptation Fund: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Diann Black-Layne (Antigua and Barbuda) and Eva Schreuder (Netherlands), parties provided comments on a Co-Facilitators’ second iteration of draft text. Views diverged on language on outstanding pledges: some developing countries and groups urged that both the amount of, and countries with, outstanding pledges be expressly stated, describing this as an accountability issue. Developed countries opposed, saying naming and shaming is not useful. Parties also disagreed on whether to: note “with deep concern” the lack of sustainability, adequacy, and predictability of funding, with several developing countries and groups preferring including the phrase, and developed countries opposing; include references to doubling climate finance, with some noting this is a CMA matter; and refer to the Fund’s resource mobilization strategy for 2017-2020 or 2022-2025. Other textual proposals focused on: language affirming that the share of proceeds with regard to transactions of emission reduction units (ERUs) and assigned amount units (AAUs) are provided to the Adaptation Fund; and clarifying funding should be predictable, grant-based, and multi-year. 

Discussions will continue in informal informals.

Matters Relating to the Least Developed Countries: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Bob Natifu (Uganda) and Jens Fugl (Denmark), parties disagreed on how to reflect, in draft decision text, the challenges LDCs face in accessing finance for the implementation of national adaptation plans (NAPs). Developing countries preferred a specific request to the GCF to provide support for LDCs’ NAP implementation. Many developed countries disagreed. They acknowledged the importance of the issue to LDCs, and the challenges LDCs face in accessing GCF funding to implement their NAPs and make progress on adaptation, but noted guidance to the GCF should be provided under the respective agenda item. A developed country group proposed bridging language to invite the LDC Expert Group (LEG) to engage with the GCF with a view to addressing challenges related to access to funding for NAPs. 

Parties did not find agreement, and the co-facilitators will consult with the SBI Chair on the way forward.

Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA)

Guidance on Cooperative Approaches Referred to in Article 6.2: Informal consultations in the morning, co-facilitated by Peer Stiansen (Norway) and Kuki Soejachmoen (Indonesia), focused on the following sections of the SBSTA Chair’s informal document containing a draft decision on Article 6.2 (SBSTA57/A6.2/InfDoc): guidance to registries; guidance to the international registry; the centralized accounting and reporting platform (CARP); and the Article 6 database.

Two parties reported back from informal informals held the previous night, noting this format had been helpful to deepen understanding of parties’ views, particularly on registries and for establishing the right level of guidance for tracking arrangements applicable and acceptable to all parties. They noted, however, that parties continue to diverge on how elaborate the guidance should be.

Parties discussed, among others: applicability of the guidance for different country circumstances, with one suggesting distinguishing between guidance applicable to all registries, applicable to parties linking their registries, and specific to the international registry; interoperability, including a communication protocol to ensure all registries “speak to one another” and appointing administrators for each registry to coordinate with one another; and access of non-party stakeholders to the international registry. They expressed diverging views on whether there should be guidance for certified emission reductions in the Article 6.2 decision.

On the CARP and Article 6 database, parties discussed, inter alia: their respective functions; unique identifiers, including whether these should be the same across the CARP and the database; and common nomenclatures in the CARP, with some suggesting these be addressed in technical discussions among the relevant registries.

Some called for simplifying the text. One party suggested prioritizing work on core operational guidance over voluntary guidelines at this session. A group suggested specifying what work needs to happen in 2023 to ensure priority issues are addressed.

On next steps, many supported mandating the co-facilitators to issue a second iteration of the draft text despite parties not having had the time to discuss sections on review and reporting tables.

In the afternoon, parties focused on a section dealing with guidelines for the Article 6 technical expert review and related paragraphs of the draft CMA decision. They identified their preferred options on issues relating to the guiding principles and scope of the review, information to be reviewed, composition of the expert review team, and procedures and format of the review.

Two developing country groups highlighted the importance of a comprehensive report and review of Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes to ensure transparency, consistency, and environmental integrity of the Article 6.2 cooperative approaches. Some parties supported the inclusion of guiding principles, while several objected, noting the Glasgow decision contains no reference to guiding principles.

One developing country group called for integrated reporting across Article 6. One developed country said the text should specify that the review will focus on the initial report and Biennial Transparency Reports, and several parties noted the text does not specify the timing or sequencing of the review, number of expert review team members, or a procedure for nominating experts to the roster of experts.

Parties mandated the co-facilitators to produce draft text based on the SBSTA Chair’s informal note and parties’ inputs.

Rules, Modalities and Procedures for the Article 6.4 Mechanism: The Co-Facilitators Sonam Tashi (Bhutan) and Kate Hancock (Australia) introduced new draft negotiating text, containing a draft CMA decision and an annex elaborating the processes defined in the mechanism’s rules, modalities, and procedures (Decision 3/CMA.3). Some parties noted they had not had time to consider the text. Other parties suggested amendments. Discussions will continue in “informal informals.”

Work Programme under the Framework for Non-market Approaches Referred to in Article 6.8: In the contact group, Co-Chairs Maria Al-Jishi (Saudi Arabia) and Jacqueline Ruesga (New Zealand) invited comments on a section of the draft text dealing with the UNFCCC web-based platform for non-market approaches (NMAs). Colombia, for the INDEPENDENT ALLIANCE OF LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (AILAC), outlined the group’s proposal for the platform, saying it would: focus on accomplishment of nationally determined contributions; require centralized management by the Secretariat; and accept, as input, best practices, lessons learned and NMAs requiring financial or other support.

Bolivia, for the LMDCs, supported language in the text requesting the Secretariat to develop and operationalize the UNFCCC web-based platform “for registry of needs and provision of means of implementation.”

The LMDCs, Senegal, for the AFRICAN GROUP, and Bhutan, for the LDCs, opposed by the US, said the platform should include a matchmaking function. JAPAN, supported by the UK, proposed “identifying” as an alternative to “matchmaking,” noting this is consistent with the Glasgow decision. The UK said the platform can be more than a repository of existing NMAs, for instance, by including contact information. CANADA supported the option of using the platform to record existing NMAs but said the option of “recording existing NMAs, intended NMAs and support available” is a possible bridging solution.

The LMDCs supported a combination of manual and automatic matchmaking, and the AFRICAN GROUP suggested the platform move progressively from manual to automatic matchmaking. The UK said some of the matchmaking options, particularly in relation to automation, would delay and complicate the work programme.

Switzerland, for the EIG, supported the platform having some manual matchmaking function, opposed the option to organize workshops to “understand the diversity of intended NMAs” and, with the EU, UK and Kuwait, for the ARAB GROUP, opposed linking the platform to the Article 6.2 CARP.

The EU opposed a separate review of the matching function, noting this can be done as part of the review of the work programme in 2026, and, with the ARAB GROUP, supported encouraging both parties and non-party stakeholders to submit NMAs.

Discussions will continue in informal informals, and the co-chairs will produce a second iteration of the text.

Subsidiary Bodies

Glasgow–Sharm El-Sheikh Work Programme on the Global Goal on Adaptation: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Mattias Frumerie (Sweden) and Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago), parties continued interventions on the work done in 2022 and guidance for the 2023 work programme of the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA).

On the 2023 work programme, a developing country group provided details of its proposed framework and underlying contents, underscoring its priority to have a substantive decision establishing the framework at CMA 4, which was supported by several countries and groups. Two developed countries questioned the need for such a framework and said the proposal raises numerous substantive questions that cannot be resolved at CMA 4.

On the four 2023 workshops, parties shared proposed timings, and whether they preferred virtual, in person, or hybrid formats. Some called for interactive breakout groups, open dialogues, and a hands-on exercise to identify indicators for and a common understanding of the GGA.

Views diverged on whether to request the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to prepare a special report on the GGA, with some underscoring its importance, and others highlighting the IPCC’s already full workload. Several parties proposed including in the decision text a clear mandate for the GGA’s work to feed into the first and succeeding Global Stocktakes (GST). 

Matters Relating to the Work programme for Urgently Scaling up Mitigation Ambition and Implementation: Carlos Fuller (Belize) and Kay Harrison (New Zealand) co-facilitated informal consultations and introduced new draft text containing draft SB conclusions and a draft CMA decision including an annex containing the proposed thematic areas of the work programme. Most parties agreed that the list of proposed thematic areas was too long, with some preferring to delete the list entirely and simply have the work programme or SB Chairs select thematic areas.

Parties also considered the draft CMA decision, and called for including references to: the urgency of mitigation action; the mitigation elements of the Glasgow Climate Pact decision (1/CMA.3); a clear link to the GST and to the annual high-level ministerial roundtable on pre-2030 ambition, for instance requesting the work programme to submit an annual report to the roundtable; the role of non-party stakeholders; operational details of the work programme, such as on training and capacity building; and requiring the annual report of the work programme to include recommendations for mitigation actions to increase ambition. Several parties opposed reference to a review or suggested specifying that it would be a review of the technical modalities of the work programme and not of the work programme itself. 

In the Corridors

Finding their way back to the negotiating rooms in the morning, Article 6 negotiators reflected on the work still ahead, with one delegate noting the text on cooperative approaches was “as complicated as the floorplan to this conference.” A co-facilitator describing himself as a “map nerd” admitted to having been lost at the venue every day, noting he wouldn’t want to be similarly “lost in registries.” Despite the fast-approaching closing of the Subsidiary Bodies, Article 6 delegates still maintained their determined spirit, mandating the co-facilitators to produce new text to capture progress and expressing willingness to engage in further “informal informals” to expedite solutions.

Discussions in other rooms, however, reminded delegates that they were dealing with real-life impacts across societies, which call for urgent action and support: a delegate from Palau shared it is increasingly difficult for him to justify attending technical work on the new finance goal, seeing the lack of meaningful outcomes from the intergovernmental process. One seasoned observer philosophized on the parallels between Sharm El-Sheikh and Las Vegas, both in terms of the city’s urban planning and the deliberations at the venue: “it really feels like countries are gambling with the world’s future.”

      The fourth day of the Sharm El-Sheikh Climate Change Conference was finance-heavy. Ministers discussed expectations for the new collective quantified goal on climate finance and negotiators advanced work on the provision of guidance to climate funds. Fear is growing about lack of safeguards built into the Article 6.4 mechanism for cooperative implementation of the Paris Agreement.

CMA

Guidance to the Green Climate Fund; Guidance to the Global Environment Facility: This joint contact group was co-chaired by Richard Muyungi (Tanzania) and Toru Sugio (Japan) who invited parties’ views on expectations on these two items.

On guidance to the Green Climate Fund (GCF), South Africa, for the AFRICAN GROUP, supported by other developing country groups, called for developed countries that have made pledges to fulfill them, describing this as a major source of trust deficit. With PAKISTAN, he also expressed concern about the GCF deviating from its original character, toward becoming a “capacity- or knowledge-building entity.”

Many developing and developed countries and groups supported emphasizing the need to simplify and accelerate the Fund’s accreditation and re-accreditation processes. The EU, supported by Switzerland, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP (EIG), cautioned against micromanaging the GCF Board. AUSTRALIA and the EIG supported welcoming a programmatic approach. BOLIVIA called for a funding window dedicated to joint mitigation and adaptation, and for expedited direct accreditation for “experienced” national entities, such as development banks. Saudi Arabia, for the ARAB GROUP, lamented that some project funding due this year has yet to be disbursed.

Paraguay, for the INDEPENDENT ALLIANCE OF LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (AILAC), and Brazil, for ARGENTINA, BRAZIL and URUGUAY (ABU), called for attention to REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) results-based payments, with ABU noting that the first funding envelope was exhausted two years ahead of the original schedule and calling for a second window of resources.

On guidance to the Global Environment Facility (GEF), developing and developed countries diverged on whether the eighth replenishment (GEF-8) had successfully increased funding to the climate change focal area. Developing countries expressed different views on the System for Transparent Allocation of Resources (STAR) formula of GEF-8, with some considering it excludes countries for “political reasons.” Maldives, for the ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), drew attention to the multidimensional vulnerability index.

The AFRICAN GROUP and ARAB GROUP called for requesting the GEF to support reporting under the Paris Agreement to build the institutional capacities of national governments. The EU proposed requesting the GEF to ensure it supports the alignment of financial flows with the goals of the Paris Agreement. AILAC called for enhancing effectiveness to ensure timely disbursement of resources. The EU and CANADA called for attention to gender responsiveness.

Parties agreed to an invitation to make submissions until Thursday morning, 10 November, and discussions will continue on the basis of a compilation by the Co-Chairs.

Report of the Adaptation Fund Board: In a contact group, co-chaired by Diann Black-Layne (Antigua and Barbuda) and Eva Schreuder (Netherlands), South Africa, for the AFRICAN GROUP, supported by Belize, for AOSIS, and Nepal, for the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), proposed requesting the Fund’s Board to report how the Fund’s support is advancing the global goal on adaptation (GGA) and Paris Agreement Article 2.1(b) (on adaptation and resilience). The US supported referencing the GGA. The AFRICAN GROUP, LDCs and BENIN suggested also requesting the fund to support the implementation of national adaptation plans (NAPs), adaptation communications and related nationally determined contribution (NDC) elements.

The Co-Chairs will prepare draft text for the next contact group meeting.

CMP

Matters Relating to the Clean Development Mechanism: Co-Chairs Alick Bulala Muvundika (Zambia) and Kazuhisa Koakutsu (Japan) briefly opened the contact group outlining their plans for the session and referring to the Clean Development Mechanism Executive Board (CDM EB) report (FCCC/KP/CMP/2022/7), including a list of issues on which the CDM EB was seeking guidance or had prepared recommendations for parties’ consideration. The Co-Chairs then declared the contact group adjourned and opened informal consultations to hear parties’ views.

Parties reflected on whether guidance is needed for issuance of certified emission reductions (CERs) for monitoring periods ending before 2021. One country called for relaxed deadlines for project proponents and Designated National Authorities in the case of significant delays in operationalizing the Article 6.4 mechanism.

One group supported allowing revisions to existing CDM methodologies as needed, and another called for effectiveness and minimizing the need to “re-revise” methodologies for use under the Article 6.4 mechanism.

Parties also suggested defining, among others: how long CER cancellations should continue and be hosted in the CDM registry; when accreditation of operational entities and maintenance of their support system will stop under the CDM; and the end date for the CDM EB’s operations. One group stressed that the CDM registry should function at low cost until the Article 6.4 mechanism is operational.

Another group urged preventing an “exodus” of activities to voluntary standards and said the CDM should be placed on equal footing with voluntary carbon markets by allowing CERs issued under the provisional rules to be used for voluntary cancellation and retirement.

Parties mandated the co-chairs to prepare draft decision text, and discussions will continue in informal consultations.

Report of the Adaptation Fund Board: In a contact group, co-chaired by Diann Black-Layne (Antigua and Barbuda) and Eva Schreuder (Netherlands), developing countries drew attention to the lack of sufficiency, sustainability, and predictability of resources available to the fund, despite growing demand and ambitious strategies. South Africa, for the AFRICAN GROUP, described a “systemic failure on behalf of developed countries who continue to make false pledges” and, with CHINA, said countries should not make pledges if they are unable to fulfil them. Belize, for AOSIS, expressed concern over the Board’s inability to set a quantitative mobilization target and called for improving coverage of small island developing states. Nepal, for the LDCs, called for increasing the number of direct access entities in LDCs.

The EU pointed out that voluntary contributions by developed countries have exceeded the Fund’s mobilization target. SWITZERLAND suggested guidance on coherence and complementarity, and reflecting the fund as a good example of efficiency in accreditation and project approvals.

The Co-Chairs will prepare draft text for the next contact group meeting.

Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI)

Fourth Review of the Adaptation Fund: In informal consultations, the Adaptation Fund Secretariat provided an overview of the Fund’s new resource mobilization strategy. Co-Facilitator Diann Black-Layne (Antigua and Barbuda) invited comments on a Co-Facilitators’ draft text. Parties expressed general satisfaction with the text.

Developing countries supported a paragraph on doubling developed countries’ adaptation finance provision, with some calling for referring to “at least doubling” in line with the Glasgow Climate Pact. One developed country requested deleting the paragraph, noting the pledge was not Adaptation Fund-specific.

On a paragraph referencing diversification of the donor base, developing countries generally opposed the language, proposing alternatives, including reflecting the current scope of donors or referring to a variety of sources, with one group noting support by developing country stakeholders is voluntary. Some developed countries pointed out this language is consistent with the Fund’s mobilization strategy.

National Adaptation Plans (NAPs): Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Pepetua Latasi (Tuvalu) and Jens Fugl (Denmark). Latasi noted that, based on the previous day’s discussions, the draft text on NAPs dated 9 June 2022 had been made available to use as a basis for discussion. A developed country group suggested focusing on unresolved issues, and not reopening previously agreed text. Some developing country groups opposed, preferring instead to consider the entire text open for negotiation. Confusion ensued about various versions of the draft text in circulation, after some parties noted that the version they had did not contain certain paragraph numbers read out by others. Parties agreed to confer on the correct version of text and share it with the Secretariat for uploading to the website before the next informal consultations.

Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA)

Guidance on Cooperative Approaches Referred to in Article 6.2: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Kuki Soejachmoen (Indonesia) and Peer Stiansen (Norway) invited parties’ views on the issue of infrastructure, including the international registry, the Article 6 database and the centralized accounting and reporting platform (CARP).

Parties discussed the interoperability of registries, with most parties agreeing that the use of the international registry is not mandatory. One party questioned the need for reference to achieving consistency of data between registries, highlighting that this goes beyond the Glasgow decision, as parties are not required to connect their national registries to the international registry. A developing country group said connecting national registries with the international registry should allow for the extraction of relevant information from national registries.

One party asked for clarification of the relationship between the use of registries and tracking, and another requested development of guidelines for identification of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs). A developing country party supported storing transferred CERs in the same account as ITMOs, in order to reduce complexity.

Rules, Modalities and Procedures for the Article 6.4 Mechanism: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Sonam Tashi (Bhutan) and Kate Hancock (Australia) invited comments on the SBSTA Chair’s informal note regarding: section on national arrangement and on emissions avoidance and conservation enhancement activities; and the draft CMA decision.

Most parties preferred deferring discussion of national arrangements, and emissions avoidance and conservation enhancement activities, noting these are not necessary for operationalizing the mechanism. One party urged consideration of emissions avoidance and conservation enhancement activities, underlining the importance of such activities in preventing climate change. Another party called for additional technical work on this issue.

Regarding the draft decision, parties discussed where and when to consider the issue of further guidance to the Supervisory Body, with some noting this falls under the purview of the CMA, not the SBSTA. Another party requested clarifying that the standardized submission forms referenced in the text are not mandatory.

Having completed their first round of consideration of all eight sections and the draft decision, parties mandated the co-facilitators to prepare draft text based on the SBSTA Chair’s informal document and parties’ comments.

Work Programme under the Framework for Non-market Approaches Referred to in Article 6.8: Co-Chairs Maria Al-Jishi (Saudi Arabia) and Jacqueline Ruesga (New Zealand) invited comments on the sections in the text dealing with: a coordinating network and working groups; inputs to the review of the work programme activities in 2026; and cross-cutting matters.

On a coordination network and working groups, the EU, supported by the US and others, questioned the added value of working groups and a network to coordinate UNFCCC entities, suggesting that this work will be undertaken by the Glasgow Committee. The Gambia, for the AFRICAN GROUP, supported by Argentina, for ABU, Bolivia, for the LIKE-MINDED GROUP OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (LMDCs), and Kuwait, for the ARAB GROUP, said the Glasgow Committee only meets in conjunction with the Subsidiary Bodies, and therefore a coordination network and working groups would help speed up the operationalization of the framework for NMA. JAPAN and CANADA opposed working groups, with JAPAN supporting establishing a coordination network.

On the review, the EU said developing terms of reference on the review of the work programme in 2026 is premature, noting parties are still trying to understand what non-market approaches (NMAs) are. The AFRICAN GROUP, with the LMDCs, urged starting work on the terms of reference so these would be ready when the review is due.

On cross-cutting matters, the AFRICAN GROUP and the LMDCs underlined the need for capacity building to increase understanding of NMAs in countries, noting Articles 6.2 and 6.4 both have capacity-building programmes. The EU questioned how a capacity-building programme for NMAs would be different from existing capacity-building programmes, and CANADA supported capacity building generally, but said there is no added value of a new programme for NMAs. The UK suggested a capacity-building programme similar to those under Articles 6.2 and 6.4, with the modification that the programme would only be for identifying NMAs.

Subsidiary Bodies

Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Monika Figaj (Poland) and Milagros Sandoval (Peru) sought parties’ comments on a Co-Facilitators’ draft decision text on an enhanced Koronivia joint work on agriculture. She explained the text reflects parties’ comments but underscored it is not a final proposal. Parties appreciated the work but requested time to consider it. They exchanged preliminary views on a paragraph relating to recommendations on the different workshop reports, with some developing countries suggesting revisions and some developed countries cautioning against reopening agreed topics. Observers shared views, including on: recognizing and supporting agroecological approaches as suitable for climate adaptation and for transforming food systems; ensuring that resources support producers, including smallholder farmers, fisherfolk, and Indigenous and local communities; training on agroecological approaches; incorporating gender; ensuring coherence with other policy recommendations on agriculture and land across UN bodies; and collaborating to ensure economic survival as extreme weather events increase.

Glasgow–Sharm El-Sheikh Work Programme on the Global Goal on Adaptation: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Mattias Frumerie (Sweden) and Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) outlined the aim of the discussions as capturing progress made throughout 2022 and providíng guidance and concrete ways forward for 2023. On work conducted in 2022, several developing country groups expressed concern with the fact that the work programme’s launch was delayed for over six months, leaving little time between the four workshops for sufficient reflection and preparation. They also expressed concerns about the workshops’ format, with many emphasizing the need for hybrid participation opportunities, attention to time zone differences and balanced geographical representation. On ways forward, several developing country groups proposed establishing a framework that can enable the full implementation of the Paris Agreement towards achieving the GGA. Parties made concrete suggestions on the framework’s structure. Proposals included: focus areas, like vulnerability and risk assessment, planning, implementation, and finance; sectors, like water, food, and health; principles, like equity and common but differentiated responsibilities; and indicators.

Matters Relating to the Forum on the Impact of the Implementation of Response Measures: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Andrei Marcu (Papua New Guinea) and Daniel Waterschoot (EU), parties’ discussions centered on the midterm review of the forum, particularly the additional activities listed for that review. Two developing country groups, opposed by some developed countries, stressed the need for these activities to be part of the review, citing mandates from the Glasgow Climate Pact. On an additional activity related to the phasedown of unabated coal, one developing country urged removing the reference, saying it is a “red line.” A developed country suggested that phasing down unabated coal could be a cross-cutting issue in the workplan.

Mandated Events

Second meeting of the technical dialogue under the Global Stocktake: Several sessions took place as part of the second meeting of the dialogue. Among them, two roundtables: one on mitigation, including response measures; and the other on adaptation, including loss and damage. The technical dialogue aims to identify good practice and opportunities for enhanced action and support, and to address barriers and challenges to climate action. Each roundtable had four breakout groups allowing participants to discuss topics in depth with experts and facilitators. Mitigation breakouts covered global mitigation pathways, transforming energy and industrial systems, transforming land and other systems, and response measures. Adaptation breakouts covered developing countries’ adaptation efforts, enhancing implementation of adaptation action, adequacy and effectiveness of ongoing adaptation and support, and loss and damage. Later in the day, a session was devoted to focused exchanges on intersections across the thematic areas of the Global Stocktake.

2022 High-Level Ministerial Dialogue on the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance: In his opening remarks, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell admonished against repeating the mistakes related to the USD 100 billion goal, underscoring that transparency and accountability must be ensured—both to build trust and to inform investment decisions.

Wael Aboulmagd, Special Representative of the COP 27 President, recalled that the Presidency will prepare a note synthesizing the discussions to provide guidance for technical work in 2023, and invited parties to support the endeavor.

Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director, International Monetary Fund, underscored the need to gain clarity on the scale of investment needs and on the definition of climate finance. She noted trust being eroded from both unmet funding promises and lack of clarity on how funding is used and with what impacts.

Federica Fricano and Kishan Kumarsingh, Co-Chairs of the ad hoc work programme on the new collective quantified goal, presented insights on technical work conducted in 2022 (FCCC/PA/CMA/2022/5) and highlighted areas in which further guidance is needed, including on whether the goal should include one or several quantitative elements and which elements could be quantified.

Ministers suggested, among others:

the goal should be set at a quantitative level that reflects the scale of funding needed to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement;
	broadening the contributor base towards all that are able to contribute;
	special attention to support for least developed countries and small island developing states;
	mitigating investment risks to increase developing countries’ access to private capital;
	reforming the Bretton Woods system to ensure climate risk is mainstreamed in finance institutions; and
	launching a global-level debt cancellation initiative to free up developing countries’ fiscal space.
In the Corridors

“It is the small things that matter as well” described the general feeling at COP 27 on Wednesday. Bidding her farewell in the SB Chairs’ dialogue with observers, SBI Chair Marianne Karlsen noted that, while the subsidiary bodies’ work may seem tedious, it often provides a springboard for the big political issues. And there were big issues on the horizon. One observer suggested that Presidency consultations on cover decisions may begin on Friday, wondering which issues his constituency should push for since “this process is not delivering.”

Even in the more mundane-seeming first week, major issues began emerging. In finance discussions, developing countries’ frustration over unfulfilled pledges echoed strongly: “all we hear are excuses,” said one group in discussions about the Adaptation Fund, suggesting that the lack of implementation of the pledge made in Glasgow to “at least double” adaptation financing was akin to “misleading and abusing public trust.”

In Article 6 discussions, too, a storm was brewing, with observers lamenting that the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body’s recommendations regarding removals activities under the mechanism “open the door to the wrong kind of removals.” The recommendations concern removal activities in general and do not contain specific requirements for land- and engineering-based removals, such as forestry activities and carbon capture and storage. For many observers, the lack of specific requirements potentially allows inclusion of such activities without the necessary social and environmental safeguards. “It stinks” concluded a delegate, as they walked away into the night, navigating past a major sewage leakage on the conference premises.

      The busy third day of the Sharm El-Sheikh Climate Change Conference saw delegates dashing from room to room, trying to keep up with back-to-back negotiating sessions on a variety of topics, from finance to adaptation and loss and damage. In parallel, world leaders issued calls for increased climate action in the High-Level Segment, with some even joining in on the negotiations on funding arrangements for loss and damage.

High-Level Segment

Throughout the day, Heads of State and Government shared statements, urging a spirit of cooperation in working together to redirect the world to a climate- and Earth-friendly path.

Gaston Browne, Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), said fossil fuel companies must pay a global carbon tax to fund loss and damage, and COP 27 must unequivocally establish a loss and damage fund to be operationalized by 2024.

Macky Sall, President of Senegal, called for an ambitious decision on finance, saying Africa’s vital interests cannot be ignored. Nonetheless, he said, Africa has a key role to play in achieving low-carbon development resilient to climate change.

Estonian President Alar Karis urged parties to think globally, noting the largest gains for climate can be achieved by supporting efforts beyond national borders, such as initiatives in the Arctic and the Global South.

Polish President Andrzej Duda warned: outsourcing production of goods does not remove responsibility for the related emissions; and the Russian war has generated unnecessary emissions greater than those that some developing countries emit in a year, underscoring the need to become independent from Russian fossil fuels.

Ranil Wickremesinghe, President of Sri Lanka, stressed lack of capacity as the biggest constraint to successful climate action.

Matamela Cyril Ramaphosa, President of South Africa, underscored that the fact that developed countries are not honoring their commitments breaks trust in the process.

Azali Assoumani, President of Comoros, highlighted Comoros’ immense renewable energy potential and called for developed countries to make significant progress on delivering the USD 100 billion annual commitment.

Bulgarian President Rumen Georgiev Radev stressed that climate change is a global threat and can only be addressed with global responses.

Mohamed Menfi, President of Libya, spoke about the adverse consequences of climate change in agriculture-based developing countries.

Lazarus McCarthy Chakwera, President of Malawi, shared his initial hesitation to attend COP 27, seeing the lack of progress in the middle of several global crises, but said his faith in countries’ willingness to fight for humanity had prevailed.

Alexander van der Bellen, President of Austria, underscored his country will assume its responsibility by significantly increasing its budget for international climate finance. He noted that from 2023-2026, the Austrian Ministry for Climate Action will allocate an additional EUR 220 million to international climate finance.

Nicolás Maduro Moros, President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, said the capitalists of the world have contaminated the planet for over 200 years, indiscriminately exploiting the resources of the planet for a few. Recalling Hugo Chavez’s words, he asked to “change the system, not the climate.”

COP

Long-term climate finance: The contact group was co-chaired by Carlos Fuller (Belize) and Gertraud Wollansky (Austria), who invited views on expectations for the agenda item and elements for the decision text.

Ecuador, for the G-77/CHINA, underlined that the group’s mandate is to identify lessons learned from the USD 100 billion goal, and noted that the Biennial Transparency Reports (BTRs) should be the main source of information for assessing achievement of the goal. He highlighted the Standing Committee on Finance (SCF) report on progress towards achieving the goal.

SWITZERLAND reiterated her understanding that the main reason for not concluding this agenda item at COP 26 was to continue to track progress in achieving the USD 100 billion goal. She urged considering all key findings of the SCF report. Saudi Arabia, for the LIKE-MINDED GROUP OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (LMDCs), called for more work on defining climate finance, noting the SCF report unduly emphasizes certain definitions that favor a small group of parties.

Maldives, for AOSIS, called for: a decision in which developed countries commit to an upward trajectory toward achieving their finance commitment; an implementation plan; and clarity on the definition of climate financing, noting that non-concessional loans are not climate finance.

Costa Rica, for the INDEPENDENT ALLIANCE OF LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (AILAC), said the COP decision should identify the need to: scale up public finance; and provide additional grants-based public finance for adaptation, and for loss and damage.

The UK expressed disappointment that the USD 100 billion goal was not met and acknowledged parties’ frustration. He reiterated his government’s commitment to triple adaptation funding to GBP 1.5 billion by 2025, and the target of spending GBP 11.6 billion on international climate finance.

The Gambia, for the LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCs), called for a roadmap for delivering on the USD 100 billion goal, and for equal consideration of mitigation and adaptation. He underlined the need for a single, operational definition of climate finance.

COP/CMA

Matters relating to funding arrangements responding to loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including a focus on addressing loss and damage: Co-Facilitators Julio Cordano (Chile) and Ursula Fuentes (Germany) invited parties to identify their desired final outcome from COP 27 on this agenda item.

A Head of Government, supported by several parties, called for a new funding pathway to help accelerate the transition to renewable energy and climate resilience, in the form of a “fit-for-purpose” multilateral loss and damage response fund. He said the fund should be designated as an operating entity of the Financial Mechanism and become operational by 2024.

One developing country called for recognition of the finance gap and for new resources for developing countries to address loss and damage, highlighting that this is an issue of survival. Another called for a way to address slow onset non-economic loss and damage, such as loss of cultural heritage.

One party called for “form before function” and said the institutional arrangements must be under the COP, not the CMA or jointly under both, and should be open to all developing countries. Another party said the fund should operate ex-post, focus on rebuilding and should be accessible immediately, within 24-48 hours of a climate event.

CMA

New collective quantified goal on climate finance: Contact group Co-Chairs Georg Børsting (Norway) and Zaheer Fakir (South Africa) invited parties’ views, including on: substantive elements of work completed in 2022 for capturing in a draft decision; and guidance for the ad hoc work programme on the new collective quantified goal (NCQG) in 2023.

On work to be captured, Ecuador, for the G-77/CHINA, with other developing country groups, described technical expert dialogues (TEDs) in 2022 as repetitive of long-standing issues and not useful for advancing the mandate at hand. He called for a more structured work programme and a decision text structured around elements that would form an eventual decision in 2024, cautioning against “a last-minute political outcome” from this session.

On guidance, many developing countries called for a clear roadmap for work in 2023 and 2024. Many developing and developed countries converged on requesting for submissions prior to, and using these to better structure and focus, TEDs.

On guidance elements, developing countries outlined, inter alia: quantitative elements, including quantity and a timeframe for the goal; qualitative elements, including guidelines for instruments, channels to be used, balance between adaptation and mitigation, reference to loss and damage, and improved access; and principles, including equity and common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR), needs and priorities of developing countries, additionality, predictability, a focus on public, grant-based and concessional sources, and neutrality to policies, technologies, and sectors. Developed countries suggested including impacts of finance provided and enabling environments, among others.

Parties’ views diverged on: whether there should be an early agreement on the quantity or timeframe of the goal; whether the NCQG applies to developed countries only or is a global effort; the role of private finance within the goal; and which aspects require political-level discussions.

Various groups expressed willingness to submit draft decision text as a basis for conversations. A high-level ministerial dialogue on the NCQG will convene on 9 November and the contact group will reconvene on 10 November.

Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI)

National Adaptation Plans: Informal consultations, co-facilitated by Pepetua Latasi (Tuvalu) and Jens Fugl (Denmark), began with SBI Chair Marianne Karlsen reminding parties of the need for a robust outcome on national adaptation plans (NAPs). Co-Facilitator Fugl reminded the objective is to consider information from the reports of the Adaptation Committee and the Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG), including on gaps and needs in the formulation and implementation of NAPs, and to take further action. A developing country group expressed displeasure over the lack of progress on this item at SBI 56 and its expectation that discussions would focus on implementation and addressing gaps and needs.

Discussions addressed: shared concern about the low number of NAPs submitted; the need to facilitate access to adequate finance by developing countries, not only to formulate, but also to implement NAPs, and to improve access to the GCF; and ensuring funding allocation covers the whole NAP process and is proportional to developing countries’ needs. Parties agreed to build on the June work.

Matters Relating to the Clean Development Mechanism Registry: Co-Facilitators Sonam Tashi (Bhutan) and Kate Hancock (Australia) invited parties to share their expectations on this item, with a view to recommending a decision for the CMP to operationalize transfers of certified emission reductions (CERs) from the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) registry to the Article 6.4 registry. They highlighted a technical paper prepared by the Secretariat on the technical and process-related aspects of such transfers.

Many developed countries and one developing country group stressed the need for clarity on the role of host countries in approving the transitions. This was opposed by two developing country groups, which underscored that, while it would be important to inform the host country, there are no implications from the transitions for host countries, such as corresponding adjustments.

Parties reiterated that transferred CERs should be identified as pre-2021 CERs coming from the CDM. They also requested: clarity on whether transfers could occur from pending accounts, with many stressing this was not their understanding; further elaboration of the transition process and cancellations; and what will happen to CERs that remain in the CDM registry.

Parties mandated the co-facilitators to prepare draft text.

Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA)

Rules, Modalities and Procedures for the Article 6.4 Mechanism: Informal consultations, co-facilitated by Sonam Tashi (Bhutan) and Kate Hancock (Australia), focused on the following sections of the annex to the SBSTA Chair’s informal document containing draft CMA decision text (SBSTA57/A6.4/InfDoc): reporting by host parties of activities and issued emission reductions; operation of the mechanism registry; processes for implementing the shares of proceeds for administrative expenses and adaptation; and processes for delivering overall mitigation in global emissions (OMGE).

On reporting, parties exchanged views on the timing of authorizations of Article 6.4 emission reductions (A6.4ERs), including at registration, issuance, or any time. Some cautioned against creating additional reporting obligations, and others suggested encouraging sharing of information between the mechanism’s Supervisory Body and host countries to facilitate reporting and avoid duplication of Article 6.4 and 6.2 reporting.

On the registry, countries drew attention to the relationship between the Article 6.4 registry and the Article 6.2 international registry, highlighting the need to: unpack this relationship; ensure interoperability; align nomenclatures; and demarcate a division of labor between the two.

On administrative share of proceeds, countries welcomed the Supervisory Body’s recommendations on this matter, with some noting this decision should be taken by the CMA. On share of proceeds for adaptation, parties converged on an option to allow the Adaptation Fund Board to develop and implement a monetization strategy.

On OMGE, many supported removing language on “authorized” and “non-authorized” A6.4ERs, pointing out that the CMA guidance from Glasgow defines that cancellation applies to all issued A6.4ERs.

Informal consultations will continue, focusing on the remaining sections and cover of the draft text.

Work Programme under the Framework for Non-market Approaches Referred to in Article 6.8: Welcoming delegates to the second meeting of the Glasgow Committee on Non-market Approaches, Co-Chairs Maria Al-Jishi (Saudi Arabia) and Jacqueline Ruesga (New Zealand) invited parties to comment on sections of draft decision text, made available earlier in the day, on: a schedule for implementing the framework’s work programme activities; and additional focus areas of these activities.

On the implementation schedule, the LMDCs stressed the need for a longer-term view of activities and, with ARGENTINA, BRAZIL and URUGUAY (ABU), Bhutan, for LDCs, Kuwait, for the ARAB GROUP, the US and JAPAN, supported having two phases, with most supporting assessing the outcomes after each phase. The EU and SWITZERLAND favored a one-year mandate for activities.

On additional focus areas, the EU and the US called for focusing on three areas already identified in the Glasgow decision on Article 6.8 (4/CMA.3). AILAC, supported by the Bahamas, for AOSIS, suggested, as a compromise, maintaining a long list of additional focus areas, but allocating these under the three areas.

Subsidiary Bodies

Matters Relating to the Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement: The contact group was co-chaired by Hana Al-Hashimi (United Arab Emirates) and Alison Campbell (UK). Bolivia, for the G-77/CHINA, lamented that insufficient time has been allotted to address the Global Stocktake (GST) during COP 27. Algeria, for the ARAB GROUP, called on the co-chairs to prepare a reflection note on the outcome of the technical dialogue. Colombia, for AILAC, stated that, while the technical dialogue has been a success, the time allocated for contact group discussions is insufficient. Kenya, on behalf of the AFRICAN GROUP, said the technical dialogue should identify financial opportunities and solutions for overcoming barriers. Brazil, for ABU, underscored the difficulty of discussing expected outcomes seeing that the technical dialogue is still ongoing. Switzerland, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP (EIG), shared the group’s expectation to adopt, at CMA 4, a short decision that recalls the mandate of the GST.

Report of the Adaptation Committee: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Pilar Bueno (Argentina) and Morgane Chiocchia (UK), parties considered: whether to welcome or note the Adaptation Committee’s report and its annexes (FCCC/SB/2022/5, Add.1 and Add.2); the need to strengthen engagement with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), with some developed countries opining this is already being done and several developing countries highlighting engagement to date has been general, whereas specific substantive engagement is needed on adaptation matters. Discussions pertained to, among others: closing the adaptation finance gap, including to support developing countries in formulating and implementing NAPs; developing countries’ training needs; whether the Glasgow–Sharm El-Sheikh work programme on the global goal on adaptation is to be carried out by the SBs or the Adaptation Committee; and inviting the IPCC to update its 1994 Technical Guidelines for Assessing Climate Change Impacts and Adaptations. The co-facilitators will circulate draft text on the report and the review, noting a slot for informal informals.

Matters Relating to the Work Programme for Urgently Scaling Up Mitigation Ambition and Implementation: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Carlos Fuller (Belize) and Kay Harrison (New Zealand) invited comments on: linkages between the mitigation work programme and other UNFCCC programmes; inputs to, and outputs from, the work programme; scope, elements, and selection of work areas; and framing principles.

Parties identified linkages with: the GST; the High-Level Ministerial Roundtable; and ongoing finance discussions especially those related to Article 2.1(c) (on consistency of finance flows).

On inputs, parties highlighted: exchange of views and submissions from parties and non-party stakeholders on lessons learned in implementing nationally determined contributions (NDCs); IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and the Working Group reports; various reports including from the SCF, UN Environment Programme and International Energy Agency; NDC synthesis reports and other Secretariat reports; and outputs of the Ministerial Roundtable.

On outputs, most supported a summary report from the work programme, with many proposing this should be prepared by the co-facilitators. Some parties suggested that the report should contain information to help parties enhance their ambition or implementation, and one said the output should include a way to track progress in the creation of incentives and opportunities for increasing ambition. One party proposed a Sharm El-Sheikh interactive dialogue. Several parties opposed a negotiated outcome such as a CMA decision telling parties how to enhance ambition.

On scope, elements and selection of work areas, parties outlined topics including: challenges faced by developed countries in meeting their pre-2020 mitigation commitments and lessons learned; equitable division of the carbon space and allocation of a carbon budget among developed and developing countries; closing the mitigation gap to stay below 1.5°C; and financing frameworks for mitigation, especially for conditional elements of NDCs. Some parties opposed negotiating or discussing work areas or topics, preferring this selection to be done by the work programme co-chairs.

On framing principles, some parties opposed including any, noting the difficulty of negotiating and agreeing on principles, and pointing out that the work programme is under the UNFCCC, and therefore the UNFCCC principles apply to it. Other parties identified: equity and CBDR and respective capabilities; reliance on best available science; and urgency of action.

Report of the Executive Committee of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts (WIM ExCom): In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Cornelia Jäger (Austria) and Lucas di Pietro (Argentina) sought parties’ views on a draft decision text they prepared subsequent to the first informal consultations on Sunday, 6 November. Parties considered that the text adequately captures views and welcomed it as a basis for further discussion. They exchanged views on: encouraging active outreach on technical assistance support already available through the Secretariat, and whether this is more appropriately considered in the discussions on the Santiago Network; and whether to request the WIM ExCom to collaborate specifically with the Consultative Group of Experts (CGE). Some developed countries cautioned against singling out the CGE, while several developing countries highlighted this as a priority for them. Parties agreed to confer informally and propose agreed text for swift consideration on Wednesday, 9 November, to free up the last allocated session to discuss matters related to the Santiago Network.

Santiago Network of the WIM: In informal consultations co-facilitated by Jäger and di Pietro, parties continued discussing the network’s terms of reference; criteria for selecting its secretariat; and the advisory board. Several pointed to the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN) as a model for the network. Some developing country groups noted the network’s structure should include an independent advisory board, a dedicated Secretariat, and a network of members, and called for ensuring it is country driven. Responding to some parties suggesting advisory services instead of an actual board, several developing country groups reiterated they viewed an advisory board as critical for policy guidance provision and oversight, and that it should be accountable to the COP and CMA. They also highlighted the need for the network to have additional and predictable funding, different from the funding arrangements for loss and damage under the new agenda item. The co-facilitators will prepare a high-level “skeleton text” to facilitate consideration of various elements.

Mandated Events

Assessing adaptation needs - Findings from the IPCC WG II contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report: Hans-Otto Pörtner and Debra Roberts, IPCC WG II Co-Chairs, highlighted that adaptation is urgent, as climate change impacts are already unfolding and will continue to mount over the coming decades. Adaptation Committee Co-Chair Shella Biallas presented the Committee’s technical paper on assessing adaptation needs. She noted adaptation needs are situation-specific and dynamic, and highlighted using participatory approaches and considering transboundary risks in needs assessments. IPCC WG II authors shared insights on: additional research needed to support developing countries’ assessment of adaptation needs; methodologies for such assessments, especially for countries and regions with capacity constraints; and ways to integrate concepts such as climate-resilient adaptation pathways into the assessment. Authors pointed to the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative and highlighted new insights on “maladaptation,” a concept that refers to unintended negative impacts from adaptive responses, such as in the context of monoculture tree plantation initiatives.

In the Corridors

“This reminds me of an ant nest,” observed a delegate, as leaders shuffled between speeches, roundtables and bilaterals. Despite this high-level hustle and bustle, delegates engaging in the actual negotiations managed to have a full day of sessions. “We’re already in Groundhog Day mode,” noted one participant rushing between meetings, “there’s the same old views in the rooms and the same old problems with room capacities.”

More optimistic observers noted that many items made good progress, “especially considering we are only three days in.” Article 6 negotiators met throughout the day for constructive exchanges on a large amount of technically complex issues. On several items, parties also met in informal informals aimed at speeding up the deliberations and working towards agreed text.

The strongest sign of resolve yet manifested in the negotiations on funding arrangements for loss and damage. Some political leaders did more than just brief their negotiators, as UNFCCC Executive Secretary Stiell had asked: they went straight into the informal consultations themselves.

Still, many wondered whether and how the technical and political-level discussions in Sharm El-Sheikh would eventually tie together, pointing to the COP 27 President’s announcement that he would prepare a synthesis of the high-level discussions to serve as the “political compass for the outcomes of the ‘implementation COP’.”

      Heads of State and Government and their entourages took over the conference venue on the second day of the Sharm El-Sheikh Climate Change Conference. With their presence, leaders aimed to signal sustained momentum on climate action. In parallel, intergovernmental negotiations got up to speed. Discussions on some agenda items, such as those related to cooperative approaches under the Paris Agreement (Article 6.2), drew such crowds that they surpassed room capacity.

Sharm El-Sheikh Climate Implementation Summit

Opening Ceremony: Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi highlighted the Climate Implementation Summit’s theme, “together for implementation.” He said parties must deliver practical roadmaps that clarify how they plan to reduce emissions, prioritizing the needs of developing countries, particularly in Africa. He called for the unnecessary war between the Russian Federation and Ukraine to stop.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres cautioned that the war in Ukraine is no reason to backslide on climate action. He called for: all G20 countries to accelerate the transition to renewables; a climate solidarity pact, especially between developed countries and emerging economies, with leadership by the US and China; taxing windfall profits of fossil fuel companies; and universal early warning system coverage within five years. “Cooperate or perish,” he warned, adding that “failure to deliver on climate is a collective suicide pact.”

Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates, called for collaborative efforts on climate action, fostering innovation and economic diversification. He stated that his country will remain a supplier of oil and gas for as long as the world needs it, and is promoting investments and partnerships for sustainable economic and social development.

Macky Sall, President of Senegal and Chairperson of the African Union, lamented that current levels of adaptation finance do not meet Africa’s needs, as set out in countries’ NDCs. He urged developed countries to honor their commitments, including the USD 100 billion goal, stressing that “those who pollute more have to pay more.”

Minouche Shafik, Director, London School of Economics, called for a green industrial revolution, concessional finance, and tripling lending for clean energy. She said carbon markets should be a source of income for carbon sink-rich countries.

Leah Namugerwa, a youth climate activist, queried whether, for world leaders, justice means to “choose profits over lives,” and warned they will be remembered as doing “a lot of nothing while in power.”

Al Gore, former US Vice-President, urged ending fossil fuel colonialism, reforming the World Bank, and unlocking access to private capital to meet the USD 4.5 trillion of climate finance needed annually.

Veronika Eyring, University of Bremen, emphasized science clearly shows that “we are not on track” and urged promoting nature-based solutions that help restore ecosystem services and preserve societies.

Mia Mottley, Prime Minister of Barbados, questioned the lack of progress towards keeping in line with 1.5°C and lamented the lack of clean technology transfer, noting that “the world today does not seem very different from when it was an imperialistic empire.” She underscored the importance of concessional funding and called for reforming the Bretton Woods system.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell asked leaders to: ensure consistency between the visions expressed in their high-level statements and their delegations’ positions in the negotiations; convene their cabinet ministers to strengthen domestic climate plans and step up implementation; and reflect the urgency of the climate crisis in all their work.

Odile Renaud-Basso, President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, speaking on behalf of multilateral development banks (MDBs), underscored that MDBs will step up support for countries and cities to engage in the net-zero transformation and place special emphasis on nature-based solutions to leverage the climate and biodiversity linkages.

Statements from leaders: President of the Republic of the Congo Denis Sassou Nguesso said reforesting the planet is one of the most relevant solutions available and noted his country has one of the lowest levels of deforestation in the world. He called for establishing a decade of reforestation.

Noting that refugees and their hosts are among the most vulnerable to climate change, King of Jordan Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein described his country’s Climate Refugee Nexus Initiative, which will prioritize support for host countries that bear the brunt of climate change, and invited other countries to endorse this initiative.

Noting that Africa is spending up to 9 percent of its gross domestic product on tackling climate change, President of Gabon Ali Bongo Ondimba called for financing for adaptation and just transitions, and said his country has absorbed close to 1.5 Gigatons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere since COP 15 in 2009.

Wavel John Charles Ramkalawan, President of Seychelles, underscored his country’s mangroves and seagrass beds not only “clean up” domestic emissions but also those of the rest of the world. Pointing to the multidimensional vulnerability index, he urged provision of concessional financing.

Klaus-Werner Iohannis, President of Romania, underscored the importance of education and research for promoting the skills needed for a low-carbon economy and highlighted adaptation as key to ensuring resilient food production and power generation amid increasing droughts.

Mohamed Cheikh El Ghazouani, President of Mauritania, highlighted his country’s success in increasing renewable energy production, including for green hydrogen, calling for partnerships to support these efforts.

French President Emmanuel Macron expressed understanding of vulnerable countries’ frustration and outlined ways to  “move the needle,” including through: joint energy partnerships with emerging economies; setting up a framework for similar partnerships with biodiversity-rich countries to support the protection of ecosystems that store high amounts of carbon; and ensuring MDBs respond to the needs of vulnerable countries.

Samia Suluhu Hassan, President of Tanzania, shared lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic and noted that science has shown a correlation between economic and environmental prosperity. She underscored her country’s challenges in raising funds to implement the necessary measures to fight climate change, and highlighted conservation measures such as tree planting and forest preservation.

Iraqi President Abdul Latif Rashid lamented that violence and war are halting development in his country. He said Iraq’s main challenge is the water crisis, noting that Mesopotamia used to have many floods but is now water scarce.

Zuzana Čaputová, President of Slovakia, reflected on how “we talked about the why and how” for too long, stressing that “now is the time to act.” She criticized short-sighted solutions, reminding that a green transition is neither easy nor cheap, and stressed that “we need to transform our collective fragility into our collective resilience.”

Faustin-Archange Touadéra, President of the Central African Republic, underscored that rich countries and top polluters are “the ones most to blame for endangering humanity,” urging those countries to financially support poorer countries’ climate action.

Filipe Jacinto Nyusi, President of Mozambique, said a fair energy transition must be gradual and reduce negative impacts on economic development. He said Mozambique will continue using its own natural resources, including gas, in the medium term.

Taneti Maamau, President of Kiribati, lamented that “major solutions remain distant because we are at the mercy of multilateral agencies who continue to determine how we adapt.” He nonetheless recognized that hope remains, and called for data, capacity building, technology transfer, and country-specific scientific projections to make adaptation planning more effective.

Kenyan President William Ruto, for the African Group, urged directing investments to Africa to leverage its clean energy potential and shared plans for a continental climate action summit in 2023 focused on sustainable economic transformation and green growth. Calling carbon credits “Kenya’s next significant export,” he urged developing carbon markets that help communities, not intermediaries.

Observing 1.5°C is out of reach without increased efforts from the G20, which account for 80% of global emissions, Swiss President Ignazio Cassis said COP 27 must launch a major work programme on mitigation and ask each country to submit a clear timeframe to divest from fossil fuels.

King of Tonga Tupou VI lamented the recent volcanic eruption in his country, noting it highlighted the need for desalination technologies to convert seawater into drinking water, and underscored the need for affordable climate-friendly transportation.

Latvian President Egils Levits urged speeding up the renewable energy transition to ensure greater energy security and mitigate climate change. He outlined Latvia’s goal to be climate-neutral by 2050, and the targets of two Latvian cities to be among the first 100 climate-neutral European cities by 2030.

Gustavo Petro, President of Colombia, proposed a “decalogue” comprising, inter alia: recognizing that markets created the problem and cannot be the main solution; the International Monetary Fund starting a debt swap programme for investment and adaptation in developing countries; and preserving the “pillars of the planet,” such as the Amazon. He said his country will devote USD 200 million annually for 20 years towards saving the Amazon.

Hakainde Hichilema, President of Zambia, said climate adaptation remains a top priority, urging progress on the Global Goal on Adaptation at COP 27. Pointing to the country’s limited resources, he underscored that Zambia will continue to do what it can to fight climate change and called for placing collective action above individual interests.

Ismaïl Omar Guelleh, President of Djibouti, highlighted that climate change impacts are a risk to public health and water infrastructure. He called for the recognition of the special needs and circumstances of Africa and urged developed countries to deliver on their USD 100 billion annual commitment.

Leaders’ statements continued into the evening and will resume on Tuesday, 8 November.

COP

Matters Relating to Finance: Guidance to the Green Climate Fund: Guidance to the Global Environment Facility: The joint contact group, co-chaired by Toru Sugio (Japan) and Richard Muyungi (Tanzania), heard views on developing draft COP decision texts on guidance to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and Global Environment Facility (GEF).

On GCF guidance, parties highlighted, inter alia: informing the GCF’s second replenishment; encouraging all potential contributors to engage; avoiding “micromanaging” the GCF Board; focusing on barriers and challenges; and improving representation of small island developing states.

On GEF guidance, parties mentioned, among others, the GEF replenishment and programming strategies.

Views diverged on whether draft guidance prepared by the Standing Committee on Finance (SCF) could be used as the basis for the draft text, with South Africa, for the AFRICAN GROUP, and Antigua and Barbuda, for the ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), opposing, noting that they had not been able to submit views on the guidance. Some suggested parties are welcome to take paragraphs from the guidance and submit these as their own. Parties agreed to invite submissions by noon on 9 November.

Review of the Financial Mechanism: Co-Chairs Kelly Sharp (Canada) and Ricardo Marshall (Barbados) opened the contact group meeting, recalling that parties had not been able to reach agreement at COP 26 to launch the seventh review of the Financial Mechanism. They clarified that the group’s mandate at this session is to adopt the guidelines for, and launch, the review.

The US noted her country’s request for a CMA agenda item on the review of the Financial Mechanism and ongoing presidency consultations on this issue. She said pending the outcome of the consultations, the US will undertake discussions on the basis that the CMA has a role in the Mechanism review. Several countries and country groups, including JAPAN, the EU, CANADA, the UK, and Costa Rica, for the INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATION OF LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (AILAC), agreed that  the CMA should have a role in the review of the Mechanism. South Africa, for the AFRICAN GROUP, supported by Saudi Arabia, for the LIKE-MINDED GROUP OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (LMDCs), Uganda, for the LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCs), and BRAZIL opposed this approach, preferring to wait for the outcome of the presidency consultations and focusing in the meantime on the review of the Financial Mechanism under the COP. Several parties also supported using the draft text from COP 26 as the basis of discussions, while the AFRICAN GROUP noted that, as the item was placed on the COP 27 agenda under Rule 16 of the draft Rules of Procedure, the draft COP 26 text cannot be forwarded to COP 27.

The Co-Chairs invited parties’ submissions on expectations and elements that should be captured in the guidelines for the review.

COP/CMA

Matters Relating to Finance: Matters relating to the Standing Committee on Finance: In informal consultations, co-facilitators Dominique Molloy (UK) and Janine Felson (Belize) introduced the documents under consideration, including the SCF report, the Fifth Biennial Assessment and Overview of Climate Finance Flows, and documents on definitions of climate finance, information relevant to Paris Agreement Article 2.1(c) (on consistency of finance flows), and progress on the USD 100 billion goal. Reminding that COP 27 and CMA 4 are expected to review the functions of the SCF, they invited parties’ views.

Many parties requested sufficient time to reflect on the various documents at this session.

On the Biennial Assessment, they highlighted, inter alia, low shares of grants, need for coherence in reporting methodologies by providers, and that less than 1% of financing is channeled through funds governed by the UNFCCC.

On climate finance definitions, views diverged on whether further work is required by the SCF and the need for a political-level discussion, with developed countries saying definitions should reflect the bottom-up spirit of the Paris Agreement and many developing countries calling for a common definition.

Several developing country groups said their views were inadequately reflected in the Article 2.1(c) mapping, while other groups and parties lamented that this issue had not been included as an agenda item. Many countries called for a political-level discussion.

On the USD 100 billion goal, developing countries stressed the target remains unmet, calling for annual progress reports to be issued through 2027.

Discussions will continue in informal party consultations.

Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI)

Matters Relating to the Adaptation Fund: Fourth review of the Adaptation Fund: In informal consultations, co-facilitators Diann Black-Layne (Antigua and Barbuda) and Eva Schreuder (Netherlands) invited parties to share expectations on elements for a draft CMP decision concluding the fourth review of the Adaptation Fund.

Many emphasized the uniqueness and importance of the Fund for developing countries, including its emphasis on grants and country drivenness, and agreed the Fund is working well.

A number of developing countries and groups lamented that a large share of pledges remain outstanding and developing countries’ adaptation finance needs are not being met. They called for referencing the Glasgow Climate Pact “pledge” to at least double the provision of climate finance for adaptation to developing countries from 2019 levels by 2025 (Decision 1/CMA.3, paragraph 18). Many stressed the Adaptation Fund is the appropriate vehicle for channeling these resources.

Noting that certified emission reductions (CERs) have not been a significant source of revenue for the Fund and voluntary contributions lead to unpredictability, developing countries and groups called for a multi-year replenishment. Countries also highlighted, inter alia, further improving direct access, results-based finance, and the Fund’s environmental and social policy.

Parties mandated the co-facilitators to prepare draft text for the next consultations based on inputs received and further submissions made by 8 November.

Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA)

Rules, Modalities, and Procedures for the Paris Agreement Article 6.4 Mechanism: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Katherine Hancock (Australia) and Sonam Tashi (Bhutan), parties agreed to use the SBSTA Chair’s informal document (SBSTA57/A6.4/InfDoc) as the basis for discussions. Parties considered the processes for implementing the use of CERs towards first or first updated NDCs. On text stating that parties should follow the guidance on using internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs) when they use CERs to achieve their NDCs, several parties underlined that CERs are not ITMOs and called for labeling to make this clear. On text stating the Article 6.4 mechanism registry may continue to receive CER transfers from the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) registry until the CMA decides otherwise, some parties preferred deleting this provision or including an end date for accepting transfers.

Parties also discussed reporting by host parties on their Article 6.4 activities and Article 6.4 emission reductions. They considered reporting options, with some stressing that Article 6.4 reporting must be separate from, and additional to, Article 6.2 reporting. Others opposed, pointing to an additional reporting burden on developing countries, and suggested that reports submitted under Article 6.4 can be used to meet Article 6.2 reporting requirements if and when emission reductions are authorized as ITMOs.

Subsidiary Bodies

Matters relating to the Santiago Network under the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage Associated with Climate Change Impacts: Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Cornelia Jäger (Austria) and Lucas di Pietro (Argentina). Participants shared their views on elements to address, inter alia: terms of reference of the Santiago Network; criteria for selecting its Secretariat; the role and composition of its Advisory Board; and the role of loss and damage contact points. A developing country group called for swiftly moving to textual work to avoid having to resort to last-minute compromises.

Report of the Adaptation Committee: Co-Facilitators Pilar Bueno (Argentina) and Morgane Chiocchia (UK) outlined two sub-items for consideration: report of the Adaptation Committee (FCCC/SB/2022/5, Add.1 and Add.2); and review of the Committee’s progress, effectiveness, and performance.

On the Adaptation Committee’s report, parties highlighted the need to: enhance engagement with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); update methodologies and tools to assess adaptation needs; and revamp the adaptation knowledge portal. They also noted the report should be revised to reflect parties’ agreement on common timeframes for NDCs.

On the review of the Adaptation Committee, parties noted the need to increase visibility of the Committee’s work, improve engagement with stakeholders and the IPCC, and enhance focus on NAPs. Some called for separate decisions for each sub-item, and for separate COP and CMA decisions, observing the CMA has no mandate to undertake the review.

Matters Relating to the Work Programme for Urgently Scaling up Mitigation Ambition and Implementation: In informal consultations, co-facilitated by Carlos Fuller (Belize) and Kay Harrison (New Zealand), discussions focused on the scope and content of the work programme. Several parties said the work programme should be a space for sharing lessons learned and knowledge on the implementation of countries’ NDCs. Others supported also considering ways to enhance mitigation ambition, noting the group’s mandate includes “scaling up mitigation ambition and implementation.” One group said the work programme should facilitate a “race to the top” where parties commit to higher mitigation targets, and one developing country said it should support closing the ambition gap for achieving 1.5°C.

On modalities, parties suggested: thematic workshops held in conjunction with the SBs in 2023; regional workshops; or an annual ministerial roundtable on pre-2030 ambition. On timelines, one party proposed a two-year work programme starting at SB 58 and ending in CMA 6, and continuing in two-year cycles until 2030.

In the Corridors

The second day of the conference opened with an impressive line-up of more than 100 Heads of State and Government arriving for the Sharm El-Sheikh Climate Implementation Summit. As a sign of times, the recurrent theme of the day, however, was the discrepancy between pledges and their implementation. “We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot still on the accelerator,” alerted UN Secretary-General António Guterres at the opening of the Summit. “Implementation is not good speech material,” one delegate quipped. “Very laudable,” said another seasoned delegate about UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell’s determination to hold leaders accountable, “but we have yet to see the spirit of the grand speeches infuse into the actual negotiations.” Announcements of new action, usually a common feature of high-level statements, were also few and far between.

The presence of world leaders at the venue was also tangibly felt as intergovernmental negotiations on a large number of items launched work in the afternoon. Negotiators in multiple rooms seemed caught in a Goldilocks-esque predicament of their negotiating rooms being either too small, too cold, or too noisy. Some negotiations, such as Article 6, had to be postponed as many parties were unable to find seats and observers were left queuing outside. “I can’t believe I came to Egypt to watch a webcast” shared a frustrated observer, “especially seeing how patchy the wifi connection is.”

      The Sharm El-Sheikh Climate Change Conference opened with a shared sense of urgency, as many speakers underscored the devastating climate impacts that manifested this year. Speeches during the opening ceremony recalled the pressing messages from climate science, pointed out the current geopolitical challenges and their effects on energy and food systems, and underscored the necessity of focusing on implementation. All bodies launched their substantive work and, in the afternoon, informal consultations convened under various bodies. A joint opening plenary also convened to hear statements from parties and observers.

Opening Ceremony

COP 26 President Alok Sharma highlighted recent reports suggesting that full implementation of current commitments will set the world on track to limit average global temperature increase to 1.7°C. Acknowledging this as insufficient, he urged world leaders to explain clearly what they have achieved in the last year and how they will go further.

COP 27 President Sameh Shoukry said recent extreme events all over the world are another wake-up call to act with all precaution in accordance with commitments and targets. He urged moving from negotiations and pledges to implementation, including scaling up ambition according to countries’ capacities. Shoukry also noted the Sharm El-Sheikh Implementation Summit starting Monday, 7 November, at the level of Heads of State and Government.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell observed that while “Paris gave us the agreement and Katowice and Glasgow gave us the plan, Sharm El-Sheikh shifts us to implementation,” underscoring that no one can be “a mere passenger.” He outlined three critical lines of action: demonstrating a transformational shift to implementation; cementing progress on workstreams on mitigation, adaptation, finance, and loss and damage; and enhancing delivery on the principles of transparency and accountability throughout the process.

Cautioning that the world is not on track to limit global warming to 1.5°C, Hoesung Lee, Chair, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), urged collective action, stressing that the range of options and time available will not be at the disposal of future leaders and policymakers.

Opening Statements

Pakistan, for the G-77/CHINA, stressed that addressing loss and damage “is not charity; it is climate justice.” He listed priorities including: agreeing on an institutional structure and operational modalities for loss and damage assistance; delivering on the USD 100 billion commitment to rebuild trust; and making progress on the amount and timelines for the new collective quantified goal on climate finance; and the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA).

The EUROPEAN UNION expressed disappointment at the lack of consensus for dedicated discussions on limiting global warming to 1.5°C and aligning global financial flows with the Paris Agreement. He called on developed countries to “step up” to deliver the collective finance goal and highlighted action on loss and damage as crucial.

Switzerland, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, warning that a COP in Africa “must not be the COP where we lose 1.5°C,” called for: a robust mitigation work programme; delivery on the “homework from Glasgow” to phase down unabated coal and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies; and progress on the technical rules on markets, ensuring human rights and environmental integrity.

Australia, for the UMBRELLA GROUP, noted the group is not coordinating with the Russian Federation and Belarus. She emphasized, among others: a robust work programme for greater ambition to keep 1.5°C alive; achieving the USD 100 billion goal imminently; aligning finance flows with global temperature goals; and operationalizing the Santiago Network on loss and damage. She welcomed the new agenda item on funding arrangements for loss and damage.

Zambia, for the AFRICAN GROUP, highlighted the special needs and circumstances of Africa. Saying adaptation is a matter of survival for the continent, he called for scaling up adaptation action and a substantive GGA outcome. He sought new, additional, predictable, grant-based and concessional financing and fulfillment of the USD 100 billion goal.

Antigua and Barbuda, on behalf of the ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), observed that “our financial system has been built around the fossil fuel industry and it is cheaper to destroy the planet than to save it.” He stressed the inclusion of an agenda item on loss and damage is “not a favor” and underscored that what parties seek is collaborative action to keep 1.5°C alive.

Senegal, on behalf of the LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCs), noted that the world is simultaneously curbing global warming while adapting to a warmer planet, which requires significantly more finance. She stressed the need to focus not only on adaptation, but also on loss and damage, underscoring that “those who are suffering from the climate crisis cannot wait for negotiators to deliver.”

Venezuela, for the BOLIVARIAN ALLIANCE FOR THE PEOPLES OF OUR AMERICA (ALBA), urged: implemention of developed countries’ commitments and responsibilities; living in harmony with nature; protecting biodiversity; and ending pollution.

Colombia, for the INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATION OF LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (AILAC), called for: science to underpin all actions; addressing shortcomings in the quantity and quality of climate finance; and concrete results on loss and damage, including access to specific and additional finance.

Saudi Arabia, for the ARAB GROUP, emphasized the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and an equitable and balanced approach that covers all articles of the Paris Agreement, and called for progress under all sub-items of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.

Bolivia, for the LIKE-MINDED GROUP OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (LMDCs), drew attention to the deepening climate injustice and lamented that developed countries are “systematically trying to shift the burden on developing countries.” He called for, inter alia, a definition of climate finance, doubling of adaptation finance, a substantive decision on the GGA, operationalization of the Santiago Network, and funding arrangements for loss and damage.

Calling for COP 27 to be above all, an “implementation COP,” Brazil, for ARGENTINA, BRAZIL and URUGUAY (ABU), stressed the need for substantive advancement on finance, adaptation, and loss and damage.

Papua New Guinea, for the COALITION FOR RAINFOREST NATIONS, highlighted that rainforest nations have already delivered more than 9 Gigatons in removals via reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+).

South Africa, for BRAZIL, SOUTH AFRICA, INDIA and CHINA (BASIC), said COP 27 should focus on ways to practically assist countries in implementing their nationally determined contributions (NDCs). He urged developed countries to honor their commitments, and called on all countries to forge a multilateral response to adapt to climate change and assist one another in dealing with the associated loss and damage.

LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES (LGMA) called for COP 27 to mark the start of a multilevel action era.

RESEARCH AND INDEPENDENT NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (RINGOs) urged parties to act with the urgency dictated by science, including via NDC revisions and support for adaptation and resilience.

TRADE UNION NGOS (TUNGOs) said implementing just transition policies and measures builds trust and called on G20 countries to step up action.

WOMEN AND GENDER called for advancing gender-responsive policies, rapid structural transformations, and climate justice.

BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY NGOs (BINGOs) urged: a clear roadmap for business investment; fulfilling the USD 100 billion commitment; and enabling full operationalization of Article 6.

CHILDREN AND YOUTH drew attention to the Global Youth Statement and lamented that accessibility to COPs remains a challenge.

Climate Action Network, for ENVIRONMENTAL NGOs (ENGOs), said the global climate crisis and the loss and damage it causes affects the rights of millions of people across the world and drew attention to the plight of climate activists and human rights defenders.

Demand Climate Justice, for ENGOs, called for a loss and damage funding facility based on public funds, just transitions, and a conflict of interest policy for the UNFCCC process.

FARMERS urged inclusive and ambitious NDCs that take into account farmers’ needs and expectations and stressed the importance of the Koronivia joint work on agriculture.

INDIGENOUS PEOPLES called for fulfilling Indigenous Peoples’ internationally recognized rights, including the right to full partnership and participation in all UNFCCC bodies.

Informal Consultations

Matters Relating to the Work Programme for Urgently Scaling Up Mitigation Ambition and Implementation: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Carlos Fuller (Belize) invited parties to focus efforts on preparing a draft decision for the CMA’s consideration by the end of SB 57 and encouraged inputs in particular on the work programme’s start date and duration. Parties converged on starting the work programme as soon as possible in 2023, but disagreed on its duration. Pointing to the reference in the Glasgow Climate Pact to “this critical decade,” several developing and developed country groups and countries called for continuing the work programme until 2030, while two developing country groups supported concluding in 2023, citing the need to complement, rather than duplicate, the Global Stocktake. The former also supported a mid-term review of the work programme, either in 2024 or 2025.

Guidance on Cooperative Approaches Referred to in Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement and in Decision 2/CMA.3: In informal consultations, Co-Facilitators Kuki Soejachmoen (Indonesia) and Peer Stiansen (Norway) outlined some of the issues the group is expected to consider, including recommendations on reporting tables and guidance, infrastructure, review, special circumstances of Small Island Developing States and LDCs, corresponding adjustments, and whether Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) should include emissions avoidance. They invited general reflections on using the SBSTA Chair’s informal note as the basis of discussions.

Several parties supported using the Chair’s note as a starting point for discussions at this session, while others noted it does not sufficiently deal with some issues such as changes to authorizations of ITMOs and the review process. One party said the note contains elements that are outside the group’s mandate or that had been intentionally rejected at COP 26, and that while it contains some options introduced at the Bonn session, it omits some in a way that prejudices the outcome of discussion at this session.

Some groups of parties suggested focusing on priority issues necessary for operationalizing Article 6.2, identifying infrastructure and reporting, review, the capacity building programme, and changes to authorizations of ITMOs. Some parties urged addressing these priority issues holistically, not individually.

In the Corridors

Taking place at the end of an economically and geopolitically difficult year for countries worldwide, many had predicted COP 27 would not be an easy one. “I only had an hour of sleep last night,” shared an exhausted delegate, “and this is only day one.” She and many others emerged from what the COP 27 President noted were 48 hours of “herculean” consultations over proposals for items to be added to the different bodies’ agendas. At the heart of these were various finance issues—key among them loss and damage finance—but also others, such as limiting global warming to 1.5°C.

With the agendas adopted after a slightly delayed start only, many felt relief. Still, statements and reflections heard from key figures through the day painted a clear picture: outgoing COP 26 President Sharma’s assertion that finance would “make or break the work ahead of us” seemed spot on. And as Executive Secretary Stiell warned, “the real test will be the quality of the discussions that will take place over the next two weeks, and the eventual outcomes.”
